Patient-psychotherapist relations are not of an adversary nature. If the patient needs to conceal aspects of her thoughts, consciously or unconsciously, that is worthy of note whenever one detects it, but it does not make her \"guilty\" of anything. It's part of the problem that you are examining. Usually this kind of a situation becomes clear over the span of several interviews, but it can also happen that one is well into a treatment program before it becomes apparent that a patient's problems and assets are not what one had thought them to be.

Lying down on a couch in itself does not make for psychoanalysis; plenty of good psychotherapy has been done under those conditions. It works the other way, too, you know.
