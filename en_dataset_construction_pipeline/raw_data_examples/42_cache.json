Jake had suffered a heart attack 8 weeks prior to our first session, and they related that a lot of the stress that \u201ccaused\u201d his heart attack came from their unhappy marriage. Unbeknownst to me, Jake had an appointment with his cardiologist between the second and third marital therapy sessions and began taking an antidepressant. When he told me, I inquired about his decision, and he informed me that he had already been experiencing the negative side effects."}
