You know, 0 would indicate that you currently have little motivation to work on the problem. On the other hand, a score of 10 would suggest optimal motivation to work on the problem. On the piece of paper I handed each of you, I want you also to predict what you think your partner will score as his or her level of motivation. Therefore, you will have two scores on your paper: One will be your own personal level of motivation. The second score will be the score you predict your spouse will record.
