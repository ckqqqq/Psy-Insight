This technique makes complex aspects of the client's life more tangible and accessible, facilitating collaboration between the practitioner and client. By scaling the miracle, the student can identify aspects of her desired outcome that are already present, consider the changes necessary for success, and envision the endpoint of therapy. This approach emphasizes the brief nature of SFBT, highlighting that the client does not need to achieve the entire 'miracle' to consider therapy successful."}
