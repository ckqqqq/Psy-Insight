Therapists may need to reactivate existing positive core beliefs or help clients identify new positive beliefs, especially in cases where long-standing negative beliefs dominate. Encouraging clients to focus on how they aspire to be, rather than dwelling on current negative beliefs, is essential for cognitive restructuring and fostering positive change."}
