Once he was talking about his life instead of his symptoms, he became brighter, more alert, purposeful.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: He sensed you could understand him, and he responded. Precisely what a melancholic or an endogenously depressed person cannot do. Were he clinically depressed, he'd have reverted to talking about his symptoms and asking you for relief, while at the same time telling you that nothing could help him, that all was hopeless, and so forth. This man is mourning his wife. Grief is not the equivalent of depression.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: It was clear to me that he was not in need of hospitalization or antidepressant medication. What he needs, I think, is someone to help him cope with his loss. He has no children or close relatives, and friends have their limits. I think I was the first person whom he could tell what his loss meant.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: Even more important, with you he probably formulated what he was going through for the first time. Having some idea of how one feels and actually voicing how one feels so as to appeal to another's understanding are two very different experiences.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: I was wondering whether I should advise him to see more people, make an effort to get out. Human contact seems to help him so much.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: Don't spoil good therapy. He'll find his way once he is free to do so. Your job is first of all to try to understand him, which you are doing with good results, and then to help him understand himself. Once you grasp what's happening to him, it seems very obvious and clear to you, but that doesn't mean he knows it yet or accepts its implications.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: When I saw Mr. Clark for his third appointment two days ago, he still looked troubled but seemed eager to go on talking about his life. He even smiled a few times when he recalled some of the vacations they took. They were both avid campers and crisscrossed the country for a month in the summer when they closed the store.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: What you are doing is fine. You are helping the patient to accomplish the work of mourning. As Freud described in Mourning and Melancholia , as a bereaved person relives each memory, the ties to the past are loosened a little bit. The events Mr. Clark is telling you about no longer belong exclusively to the past, they are given new life by your hearing about them, and in that way the present takes on meaning. Eventually the future will do so also, and then life will seem worth while again to Mr. Clark.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: How should I handle it if he brings up his insomnia or other symptoms?","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: I think you should explain to him why he's feeling this way. Help him to understand that his wife was so much a part of his self-concept that her loss leaves him with a feeling of emptiness. Without her to tell of his achievements, disappointments, and hopes there seems to be no point to doing what he's doing. He's at loose ends. What has been the focal point of his life's organization is missing, and his discomfort is to be expected.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: And that alone will help?","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: Yes, it should. Knowing why you feel the way you do lessens anxiety considerably. It's only when a patient has things happening to him that he doesn't understand that the cycle of ever-mounting anxiety gets hold of him.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: But surely he knows why he is upset.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: Yes and no. He knows his wife's death precipitated his unhappy state, but he doesn't realize he's so upset because her loss deprived him of the focus around which he had arranged his life. He's like a traveler in a totally foreign country-all the adaptive measures that have sustained him at home are suddenly inoperative.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: Should I reassure him that this will pass, that he'll be all right again?","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: This man is in a position similar to the one you and I were in when we first began our psychotherapy training. Everything was suddenly different, what we had learned in school seemingly didn't apply any more and yet we were expected to perform. When you came in here worried about your patient, do you think it would have helped you to hear from me that everything was going to be all right in time? Now that you have learned how to approach the situation, I can tell you that and you'll believe me. But until the possibility of a new and more meaningful order is experienced by someone who is confused, reassurances don't mean much. Mr. Clark needs to know, just as you needed to know, what the name of the game is and what the rules are so he can function again. Whether he'll win, lose, or draw depends on a lot of factors that aren't under our control, and we don't need to pretend that they are.","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Resident: But some patients don't want to know the truth, do they?","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: That's so, but they signal that clearly.

As a matter of fact, the last time I did coke, I did only $150 worth.","role":"user"},{"content":"Therapist: Only $150 worth! How did you resist doing the usual $400?","role":"assistant"},{"content":"Client: Well, as part of all this, I decided that I would buy only small amounts of coke at a time, instead of all at once.
