Some clients might find it difficult to pinpoint their NATs in a specific situation, but the therapist can ask such clients if they had any pictures or images in their minds in that situation which might be more retrievable (e.g. ‘I had an image of everyone turning their backs on me when I entered the room’). Then the client, in this example, can be asked what meaning he attaches to the image in order to elicit his accompanying thoughts (e.g. ‘I’ve lost their respect and I’ll never get it back’). Using imagery can help clients to relive past situations in order to uncover the hot (emotionally charged) thoughts associated with these situations. For example, a client who said she felt anxious when walking in the high street, but did not know why, was asked to imagine the situation in the present tense, as if it was happening right now:\\n',\n",

Such a puzzle is when a client presents with a situation that he says he should be very happy about (e.g. getting married) but, instead, feels worried and standard CBT questioning fails to elucidate his worry. To bring the client’s worries into focus, the therapist can use the step-up technique (Lazarus, 1984) where the client visualizes his married life unfolding and the therapist keeps ‘stepping up’ the image (moving forward in time) to the point where the worrying thoughts emerge: ‘I can see it in my mind’s eye now. Her irritating habits have become intolerable. I resent her more than I love her, but she’ll be destroyed if I leave her. So I’m trapped in the marriage and feel very unhappy.’\\n',\n",

Additionally, this question is indicated if the worst outcome is based on a highly distorted reading of future events such as ‘My whole life will be totally ruined if I fail the exam’ or ‘I’ll be so terrified of the plane crashing I’ll be running up and down the aisles screaming and vomiting over everyone’.

They’re sort of rubbish, really. They’re not driving the system’ (quoted in Weishaar, 1993: 112). Therefore, the therapist needs to sift through this cognitive outpouring carefully in order to pinpoint the hot thoughts that are ‘doing the emotional damage’. For example, a client may provide reflections on his thinking in a particular situation rather than the actual thoughts – as this client does when he muses on a boardroom incident: ‘Hmm. I think I was possibly anxious because I was wondering what the chairman thought of me when I didn’t have the exact figures he wanted. It was something along those lines.’ In order to uncover the actual thoughts, the therapist, through imagery, helps the client to recreate the boardroom incident in the present: ‘Oh God! I’ve shown myself up as a complete incompetent. The chairman has lost all faith in me. That’s the end of my career with this company.’\\n',\n",

Using words like ‘failure’, ‘useless’, ‘worthless’ or ‘no good’ to define oneself are not only dangerous overgeneralizations – a person might become depressed and consider suicide through such self-labelling – but are hopelessly inadequate and inacc- urate in capturing the complexity and uniqueness of the self. Semantic precision helps clients to be clear and accurate about events (e.g. ‘I’ve failed my driving test twice’) and what can be done about them (e.g. ‘I shall try for a third time’) instead of focusing on what they believe they are (e.g. ‘I’m totally useless. I might as well give up now’) which will prevent them learning from their mistakes and restricting their self-development such as not persevering in the face of setbacks.

In evaluating the data from the experiment, the client may have concluded: ‘If the pool had been less crowded then I would have stood out more and people would have stared and sniggered at me.’ In this case, trips to the pool could be arranged when it was less crowded to test this prediction. Also, coping responses would be developed – not only to deal with any possible sniggering but also to stay in the pool and leave when she decided to rather than prematurely because she found the sniggering unbearable. It is important not to construct experiments in terms of success or failure but to convey to clients that the outcome of an experiment is of interest whatever happens (Bennett-Levy et al., 2004), e.g. information gleaned from the experiment reveals new aspects of the problem which then helps to refine the case conceptualization or the client wants to capitalize on the ‘it went well’ outcome to speed her progress through the treatment plan. Experiments can also be based on observation (e.g. watching others cope in situations the client fears) or conducting a survey where the client gathers a range of opinions on an issue he is currently struggling with (e.g. ‘Does\\n',\n",

Instead, I will accept what has happened and see what I can do to put it right.’ Obviously, verbalizing a new assumption in the therapist’s office carries little conviction unless the client repeatedly and forcefully acts in support of it in a variety of situations where the old maladaptive assumption was operative. By the end of therapy, the client had experienced several occasions where he fell below his high standards (they did not collapse into mediocrity) and focused on ‘what went wrong and putting it right’ instead of self-condemnation. He said that the time he previously wasted ‘on feeling bad and putting myself down’ was now channelled into productive problem-solving.\\n',\n",

Core beliefs are fundamental appraisals we make of ourselves (e.g. ‘I’m not good enough’), others (e.g. ‘You can’t trust anyone’) and the world (e.g. ‘Everything is against me’). These are examples of maladaptive core beliefs – rigid and overgeneralized – which cognitive behavioural therapists help their clients to uncover. In this and the following points, (82– 84), ways of revealing core beliefs are demonstrated. The downward arrow (demonstrated in Point 71 to uncover a client’s underlying assumption) pursues the personal meaning for the client of each thought elicited until a core belief is revealed. It is important that the therapist does not engage in challenging the client’s thoughts as this will prevent the ‘arrow’ from going ‘down’ very far. Nor should she ask long- winded questions that will distract the client from the often intense introspective focus required of him for the successful completion of this exercise, or insert her own interpretations of the client’s problems into her questions (e.g. ‘It seems to me that what you’re really saying is that you’re not a successful person. What does it mean to you to be an unsuccessful person?’). In the following example, the client is very worried about her husband’s sudden willingness to stay late at work:\\n',\n",

Generally speaking, schema work is usually carried out later rather than earlier in CBT because ‘it is thought that challenging a patient’s [core] beliefs too early in therapy will be counter-productive as the patient may feel threatened and resist change’ (Blackburn and Davidson, 1995: 82). However, with clients who have personality disorders, the identification and modification of long-standing rigid core beliefs (e.g. ‘I’m bad’) starts early in therapy as these beliefs are activated in a wide range of situations and are the near-permanent outlook of such clients.

A trait, attribute, behaviour or performance does not equal the person; when clients conclude that it does they are making the ‘part equals whole’ error such as ‘My performance in that situation was inferior, so that makes me inferior’.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Unlike the possibility with self-esteem, self-acceptance does not involve a loss of identity (Neenan and Dryden, 2002). ‘Esteem’ is derived from the verb ‘to estimate’, which means to give something or someone a rating. The concept of self-esteem suggests that a person can be rated globally (e.g. ‘I’m a success because I’ve just been promoted and I have the respect and admiration of my colleagues’). Loss of self-esteem can lead to loss of identity if favourable conditions are reversed (the client loses her job in a company merger and has little, if any, contact with her former colleagues: ‘I stare in the mirror every morning and wonder, “Who am I? Where’s my life gone?”’). Self- acceptance is not based on certain criteria being met (e.g. having friends, good looks, being slim, having approval from others) in order to validate one’s self-worth or identity. If self- acceptance does have an identity, it is the acknowledgement of oneself as a fallible, complex, unrateable human being – this view of oneself can remain constant whatever the circumstances in one’s life. We believe that self-acceptance is one of the most important concepts that therapists can teach their clients to help them avoid rating the self which is implied by self-esteem. Self-acceptance is a project to work on across the lifespan, not just while in therapy.\\n',\n",

What one should never do is argue with a client about (a) seeking out medication (e.g., prescribing, unless one is licensed to do so), (b) the client’s experience of the medication, or (c) stopping the medication. People attribute change to many sources— G*d, hard work, medications, circumstances, and luck, to name a few—and asking clients to assign percentages to agentive areas of their experience allows us to focus on that which they can influence. Gregory Bateson once said that we might have to divide up the world to make sense of it, but “no necessity determines how it shall be done” (1980, p. 42). Working on what works is our solution focus; determining what parts of experience clients see as being within their control is one way to work on what works.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'As I write this, I find myself wondering as a Solution-Focused Brief Ther- apist about the purpose of all these questions. Some therapists would start by simply introducing themselves and asking about the family’s best hopes for the session, and moving to the next question from there, making sure that they heard from all family members. Personally, I like a little bit of getting-to-know-you time because it helps me settle down a bit and learn what is important to the family members. Structural Family Therapy (Minuchin, 1974) would call this joining. This sounds too much to me like a technique for getting the family to accept me. I think it’s useful for clients also to have some settling-in time and to have a chance to get to know me a little. I think of this as reinforcing a relationship and limit the time we take. Clients usually are eager to get to business. However, when children are present, parents typically enjoy hearing good things. That said, therapy can start by asking about their best hopes from the session, what would tell them that the session was useful, just their names and what they would like to be called, or something else. What is not considered useful in SFBT is to ask them about the problem that brought them to therapy. If they feel a strong need to talk about the problem, they will.\\n',\n",

However, if the structure of the family has not changed, the therapist may advise that the family continue in therapy until the executive subsystem or other system boundaries are clearly differ- ent from when the family first came to therapy. Without structural change, the family may find that another symptom develops that requires a similar change as the earlier one, substituting the identified patient or problem with another family member or situation. Using SFBT practices, the therapist may be able to determine the degree of change more easily. For example, if a family says that they are at 8 toward their goals and that’s good enough, the therapist may still ask what 9 looks like. In the above example, one of the parents may state something like, “when something else happens and we remember to use our new skills.”\\n',\n",

As the earlier example shows, WOWW coaches are keen on asking students first to honestly assess their classroom on a particular issue (e.g., how well they listen or how well they line up) and then give themselves a scaled rating between 1 and 10. The next step the WOWW coach takes is to ask more questions from the scaling sequence to help the classroom move toward setting a goal for future classroom sessions. In the case example, students said they were at about a 6.5 in terms of their listening to the teacher after lunch. This seemingly small part of the day was actually a huge destabilizer for the afternoon, as many students failed to get on track and others said they wished that the teacher didn’t have to yell so much to get the class settled. Improving this part of the day was identified by both teachers and students as a key area to focus on, and by asking scal- ing questions, the WOWW coach was able to assess how much progress the class thought was realistic for the coming week.\\n',\n",

Yet, it is always important to help the student have a say in what may happen and be aware of the help being initiated. If or when substantiation occurs, the social worker’s challenge is maintaining an appreciative and helpful relationship with the student. Contact would generally acknowledge the difficulties but focus on what the child can confirm as being helpful in making their life more manageable during school. By having the student state what it will take to keep going at this point, the social worker has validated the student’s competencies at whatever level Beth is able to man- age. Whether those competencies are attending classes, doing homework, talking with friends, not fighting as much, or being less sad, all can be appreciated for what they mean for recovery. Using scaling question may or may not feel appropriate; if used, they can provide additional supportive evidence of success.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'The above example probably sounds like an avoidance of the issues of neglect or abuse. But remember, the school social worker is not engaging in treatment; rather, the effort is to build on the student’s strengths and abilities to thrive and do as best she can. Using scaling and having the student focus on what she thinks the teacher would rate her is intentional. Not only does the school social worker help the student to provide a sense of her own place on the scale, the student is also being helped to strengthen her relationship with an important person who cares about her and believes in her ability. In the example above, it is a favorite teacher who provides her with safety and with possibilities of success. This is a necessary experience for a child who has been neglected in many ways and most likely feels abandoned by oth- ers. Losing a sense of trust and safety must be addressed by helping to build trust and support and safety in the school—or even by just one teacher and/ or the school social worker. The very fact of being focused on a potentially positive effort and, importantly, helping the student to build a stronger and supportive relationship with an adult is a significant factor in building the sense of trust and safety that is reparative of the unsafe experiences in her home placement experiences.\\n',\n",

How did you get all those bruises?” Then, the work would become focused on understanding the problem by gathering details of and facts about what was taking place in the home. This seems to be the typical way to have the conversation. Yet, Bannink (2014) notes that it is a “mis- conception that there can only be sufficient acknowledgment if the problem is wholly dissected and analyzed or if the client is afforded every opportu- nity to expatiate [or expound] on his or her view of the problem” (p. 75). Importantly, it might not have been such a full story as we just had with James. The solution-focused approach attempts to build a relationship that makes it more likely the student will reveal more information. This can lead to a better understanding and to potential resources, such as James’ cousin. It appears that James is a responsible child, even though he gets into fights with his siblings. He does provide a reasonable description of what might be considered neglect and has given a possible focus on what child protective services might want to look into. Connecting with child protec- tive services might also help James’ mother in terms of child care and other family services.\\n',\n",

Attending to this task focuses the con- versation on the future and the changes the student would like to see, rather than focusing on the problem that led the student to come to counseling.\\n',\n",

It is simply about the description. This is one of the major distinctions between solution building and problem solving. SFBT is not an approach that involves problem solving. By engaging in a solution-building conversa- tion, the client is more likely to experience, in the moment, the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that he or she will likely re-experience when the best hopes occur. In this conversation, the school social worker will experience with the student a change in how the mood of the conversation shifts. The school social worker will also notice how the student begins to express that the changes seem “like normal.” This comes about due to the great details elicited while answering the questions and makes it more likely the student will make changes that lead toward the desired future.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'In this section, the school social worker utilizes scaling questions with the student to begin to define where the student is and where she wants to go within the frame of reference of her miracle. As described by De Jong and Berg (2008), “scaling is a useful technique for making complex aspects of the client’s life more concrete and accessible to both practitioner and client” (p. 107). In this case, scaling the miracle is a useful process because it brings the miracle back into reality and allows the student to identify the bits of her miracle that are already happening. In addition, it helps the student to con- sider how close she perceives that she will need to be to her miracle picture in order to be satisfied, and also what changes will be the most important to her success. This emphasizes to the student that she does not need to make her miracle picture happen in its entirety to consider herself successful—she only has to get to a better place, as defined by herself. Asking about the point on the miracle scale where the student will be satisfied also gives the school social worker and the student an opportunity in the first session to imagine the endpoint of therapy. This helps to emphasize the brief nature of SFBT— it assumes that the student will not be in therapy forever and, in fact, will stop working with the school social worker when she is ready to continue the change process on her own.\\n',\n",

During this break, the school social worker considers what the student has said that she wants to have different, the things that social worker is genuinely impressed with about the student that relate to what the student wants to have different, and what the social worker thinks could be a useful task for the student to complete between sessions. The school social worker then returns, delivers the compliments, and follows with the task request. In this case, the school social worker chooses the task of noticing times when the student is doing a little bit better in an attempt to draw the student’s attention to these times for multiple reasons. First, this will allow the student to observe and experience herself doing better, which will build her confidence in her ability to continue changing. Second, the student will be able to make observations about what she is doing differently when she is doing better, which will give her good clues about which behaviors, thoughts, and feelings she would like to replicate. Lastly, simply by paying attention to the times when she is doing better, the student may end up hav- ing more times when she is doing better because her mind will be dwelling in this reality more of the time.',\n",

This was connected to the idea that ‘a therapeutic conversation can be punctuated as beginning with a complaint’ (1988: 88). ‘Sometimes people seem to have no complaints and their reason for being in the therapist’s office is simply that someone told them to come or someone brought them’ (1988: 87). Describing the relationship with this person as a visitor-type indicates the need to treat them as a visitor and not to impose therapy or tasks on them; instead, he recommended being complimentary, being on their side, and looking for what works rather than what doesn’t. ‘Complainant’ describes a relationship where someone recognizes there is a problem but seems uninterested or unwilling to do anything about it. The rules in approaching them are similar to the visitor. It is only when someone actually wants to do something about their problem that the relationship can be said to be a customer-type.\\n',\n",

He had come to feel that the distinctions made just a few years earlier were a distraction, leading practitioners into thinking they have to assess the motivation of clients. Rather, if we take seriously what the client wants from meeting with us, even if it is not to have to meet us again, then this is the basis for a collaborative working relationship.

Drugs workers may be required to inform their clients of the risks of drug use. Social workers are routinely expected to monitor safety and risk in the lives of many of their clients. And many practitioners play an active role in decision-making regarding the allocation of resource. Although a social worker cannot necessarily independently decide on behalf of a department whether a young person is to be accommodated by the local authority, the desperate parent will realistically believe that gaining the social worker’s support for accommodation represents a useful step towards the respite from stress and anxiety that they are seeking. And so when the solution focused social worker asks the parent about their ‘best hopes’, the parent may well respond by requesting, one way or another, that their child be removed. In such an instance, the social worker’s task is similar to that of the educational psychologist faced with a school’s wish for additional classroom support for a child deemed to have special needs, or a psychiatrist faced with a parent’s request for medication for their child’s ‘hyperactivity’.\\n',\n",

He might have continued this focus by asking, ‘As you are hugging and crying, what will you notice about your hopes for the future?’ If the client describes another positive feeling, the therapist can ask ‘How will your daughter know you have this feeling?’ Human relationships are sufficiently complex to spend many more questions on this very brief interchange. At some point, the client has to be helped to move on and broaden the description, usually with a question like ‘what else will be different?’ It would take too long to give every moment the same level of attention, so the therapist is constantly choosing to ‘zoom in’ for detail or ‘pan out’ for breadth.\\n',\n",

When I finish the message to you, I will read it to you. Then I’ll make a copy of the message and your note to me (or picture), so we’ll each have a copy.\\n',\n",

When clients get stuck, you can refer to this introduction by saying, “Remember what I said when we began about how hard it will be to answer some of these questions? Well, this is one of those hard questions.” The last thing you want is for clients to feel inadequate because they are having difficulty answering your questions. Interventions like this can be used to keep this from happening and, at the same time, build a supportive relationship.\\n',\n",

Actually, it’s clients’ ineffective coping skills associated with symptoms that become the focus of counseling. Goals can be developed from clients’ hopes related to the symptoms they present. You can help clients develop a goal from their symptom by identifying what clients want to do or feel instead of experiencing the symptom, which leads to a general description of their goal. Next, ask “detailing” questions that enable clients to specify what they will be doing or thinking when they are on the path to accomplishing their goal. The following examples show how symptoms can be reframed as goals:\\n',\n",

As noted earlier in this chapter, when “I want others to change” arises in the context of goal setting, a common response would be to ask, “How can I help you with this?” However, in the context of the miracle question, I recommend this approach instead: “Suppose _____ did change as you want. How would you react to this change?” This represents a different twist on the reciprocal relationship question called a reverse reciprocal relationship question. Instead of asking how others would change in response to the client’s different behavior, you are asking how the client would respond if the other person did in fact change as desired in the client’s miracle. Helping clients understand that their behavior would change in response to the other person’s new behavior enables clients to recognize that their own behavior changes will cause others to change as well. This leads clients to realize they may be able to bring about the desired change in the other person by changing their own behavior.

Understanding these relationships helps clients see the big picture, and clients are empowered when they discover that they can initiate change in others by first initiating change in themselves.\\n',\n",

Goals should be stated as the presence of something or start of something (positive goal) rather than the absence of something or end of something (negative goal). Well-developed goals are described in concrete, behavioral terms that state in detail—using the client’s jargon or choice of words—what the client will be doing when accomplishing the goal. Well-developed goals tend to comprise small steps or accomplishments that lead toward the larger goal. In other words, they need to be manageable and reachable so clients avoid feeling frustrated, discouraged, or overwhelmed. By keeping the steps small, clients will be able to recognize small changes. In contrast, with large goals that call for significant changes, clients may fail to notice the small but significant indications of progress. Their attention to the big picture minimizes and may even conceal the small steps of progress along the way.\\n',\n",

As an example, consider clients who are seeking to live healthy lifestyles instead of using drugs. Even one time when clients experienced the urge to use drugs but managed to skip it and wait another hour is a repeatable solution. Answering the query “How did you make it happen for this one time?” empowers clients as they recognize their resources and strengths. Counselors can then offer support and reinforcement in the form of cheerleading in recognition of clients’ efforts.\\n',\n",

The chapter presents tips and tools for exploring these occasions when things have been better and how clients made that happen. Mindmapping, cheerleading, and flagging the minefield are among the interventions presented. The chapter also describes how scaling serves to establish a baseline and measure progress and how writing a message can be used as an effective tool to reinforce additional positive change. The chapter closes with an opportunity to practice identifying instances of success and using scaling on the problem you selected for the exercise at the end of Chapter 2.\\n',\n",

As you introduce the next step in the SFBC process, you will continue to communicate your belief in your clients’ strengths and abilities by conveying the notion that your clients already have made some parts of their miracle occur. To do this, listen carefully to clients’ comments to catch words and phrases that imply things are working for them—even if only slightly. Even more important, you must train clients to pay attention to their own successes rather than their failures. For example, a client who is failing every class except one is exhibiting signs of some success in the class he or she is passing. In keeping with a solution-based approach, you need to focus on the class the client is passing and how the client is making that happen. Even slight grades of improvement furnish clues to the client’s resources for success.\\n',\n",

Maria, a 10-year-old elementary school student in the fifth grade, was continually worried about her mother’s hospitalizations. Her mother was diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder, and her mood swings scared Maria. Maria’s schoolwork suffered because of her habitual thoughts about her mother. Maria’s goal for counseling was to replace her negative thoughts with more pleasant ones. In exploring instances when she had enjoyable thoughts, Maria talked about riding her bike, playing games with her mother and friends, reading and writing at school, and the time she was able to “click off” her negative thoughts so she could have more pleasant ones. When Maria mentioned this, the focus of the session immediately shifted to the time she was able to “click off” negative thoughts and subsequently “click on” positive thoughts. Recognizing this significant event helped Maria remember how she made this happen for herself, and she recalled changing her thoughts from worrying about her mother to sports, music, and school.

With scaling, clients rate themselves on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being when things were the worst they have ever been related to their goal and 10 being the day after their miracle has happened and the problem that brought them to counseling has been solved. Scaling, which is a key component of the SFBC process, accomplishes several purposes. In the initial session, scaling provides a baseline that identifies where clients perceive themselves to be in relation to achievement of their goal. In subsequent sessions, scaling serves as a measure of progress. Just as important, when the counselor asks, “When you move up one number on the scale what will you be doing differently?”, scaling provides the basis for framing questions about what clients can do to improve.\\n',\n",

When you ask clients to rate themselves on a scale from 0 to 10, typically clients report baseline scores greater than 0—scores between 2 and 4 are common. Often the counseling interview itself causes improvement because clients begin to identify successes that were previously unrecognized. Any ratings above 0 indicate that things have been worse; therefore, something is better now, even if only a little.

In schools, students’ and counselors’ schedules may limit the time for counseling contact. Many students are willing to see their counselors only during their brief lunch breaks at school. In addition, short attention spans of some clients, especially younger children, may lessen the effectiveness of the traditional SFBC model. Faced with these obstacles, Kral (1994) found a remedy in an abbreviated application of SFBC that appears to be effective with students at all grade levels.\\n',\n",

The abbreviated form of the SFBC model presented in this chapter uses some of the same interventions as the full form of the model and can be completed in approximately 20 to 25 minutes—half the time of the full form of the SFBC model for an initial session. The chapter also includes a flow chart and note sheet designed specifically for conducting these short sessions. The techniques and interventions used in the abbreviated session are drawn from those used in the full form of the SFBC model described in the preceding chapters, so it’s important to have read those chapters before you use the abbreviated form of the model.\\n',\n",

During this exchange, “listen for better.” In other words, listen for any indication that things are better, even if just slightly. Use interventions that help clients recognize the coping skills they have used to keep their situations from deteriorating even further. Identifying how clients are coping suggests solutions. Capitalizing on instances of success—no matter how slight—in the midst of slippages can turn unpleasant experiences into moments of hope. Once instances of success or coping skills have been identified, proceed with the EARS process described previously.

When asked why he thought he was sent to see me, he finally admitted that everyone in school thinks he fights too much. He claimed that he liked to fight and that “no one had ever kicked his ass,” and he didn’t want to quit fighting. After several unsuccessful attempts to identify exceptions to his desire to fight in order to identify a goal, the session moved in the direction of trying to identify some positive things about Rudy. Pursuing information about his grades in school, I learned that he was failing every class except science. In science he was getting a grade of B. Thinking there was now something positive on which to build, I focused on finding out how he was able to do well in science class. When asked why he did so well in that class, he replied, “We get to cut stuff up.” The session continued with compliments about his success in science and his academic potential if he chose to put forth effort in his other classes. When asked if he would like to continue with counseling, he declined.

Students who involuntarily report to your office in these kinds of situations may have negative expectations about being there, perhaps recalling past confrontational exchanges with teachers or administrators in response to similar incidents.

In contrast, solution-focused counseling elicits and amplifies nonproblematic actions of involuntary or mandated students, which lead to cooperation.

This neutrality is an advantage because it helps clients remain more open to your input. With this in mind, you can use the following format and prompts to implement the solution-focused approach with students mandated to see you because of their problem behaviors in school.

Solution-focused counseling avoids this frequent source of client resistance by framing the discussion around the clients’ goals and strengths rather than the goals dictated by others. This chapter includes special recommendations for mandated clients, who represent an exception because the goal of the meeting is tied to the reason they were referred for counseling. The chapter concludes with specific tips for turning difficult situations into workable goals. The solution-focused methods presented in this chapter provide you with tools to redirect reluctant clients into willing participants in the process of overcoming their issues.\\n',\n",

As former colleagues, Dr. Sabella and I have kept in contact and, in one of our conversations about SFBC, he mentioned that he was helping counselors use solution-focused methods in meetings with parents, teachers, and students. He generously agreed to share his work with solution-focused parent–teacher conferences (SFPTC) for this edition of the book. What follows is a summary of his submission (e-mail, August 22, 2013).\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Metcalf (2001) may have summarized the difference between traditional and solution-focused conferences best when she suggested that “instead of viewing the conference as a reporting session for what is not working in school, teachers [and counselors] can construct an opportunity to discuss what is working with the student” (p. 18). The SFPTC model provides counselors with tools to promote positive, upbeat meetings that improve rapport among the stakeholders—parents, teachers, and students. The SFPTC approach leverages the strengths and resources of all the parties in a way that moves the process forward productively. The next sections describe the three steps in the SFPTC process followed by a case example.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Part 1: Briefly Explore Any Problems or Issues Counselors should start each meeting with a solution-focused question (for example, “As a result of us working together, how will we see Johnny doing better in school?”). Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.\\n',\n",

What would you be doing differently? When are you doing some of those things now?” These questions shift the meeting from a problem focus to a solution focus. Parents and teachers begin to (1) detail what they would be doing or thinking if the problem were solved and then (2) do at least small parts of those actions, which often lead the student to change as well. This contrasts with the common scenario in which teachers or parents wait for a change in the student before changing themselves.\\n',\n",

Remember that goals must be detailed, represent an action or observable behavior (not the absence of a behavior), and be within the person’s control. For example, do not allow a parent to set a goal for the teacher and vice versa. Finally, each goal should clearly contribute to the “end game,” which is the student’s success. If time permits, solution-focused scaling may be useful at this point to help reinforce progress already made and detail future progress.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Or as an alternative to Parts 1 through 3, you can use the scaling process right from the start. If you begin the meeting with scaling, it is important to have the student present and to ask the student to go first. Explain the scale and ask the student what number would indicate, in general, how he or she is currently doing in school. Next, open the discussion to others. Ask what the parent has observed at home that also would explain progress already made. Ask what the teacher has observed at school that shows signs of progress. Dr. Sabella notes that “the idea here is that we are detailing what is already working even just a little bit so that we can build on this.” After the student responds, you can ask each of the adults what they are doing that would help explain the instances of success that have already occurred. Dr. Sabella cites these examples: Mom might discover that, before the student started showing signs of failure, she was greeting him when he walked in the door and asking about his day instead of what she has been doing recently—expecting to learn that he got in trouble and looking for a teacher’s note in his backpack (true story). The teacher may discover that, compared to now, during the student’s “better days,” she would call on him more and notice his efforts to do well (another true story). Detailing progress that has already been made sets the stage for doing more of what works and identifying new actions that each person will be doing when the student is more successful in terms of the goal.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'After some pleasantries were exchanged, the counselor set the stage for Part 1 of the meeting by saying, “We are here to focus on Joanie’s progress and how she will get back on track to meeting expectations. My goal is to make sure each of you gets a chance to speak and that we come up with a plan that works. My understanding is that your grades have slipped, Joanie. Let’s start with you. What do you believe you will be doing better when you are back on track?” Joanie responded, “I don’t know, maybe do more work?” The teacher abruptly spoke next, without a prompt, saying that he agreed. He indicated that Joanie has shown she can do the work and he has enjoyed having her in class. Then he began to describe problems and deficits—she doesn’t bring her book to class, she doesn’t participate during class—at which point Joanie’s mother became visibly agitated. Joanie’s mother responded by citing reasons why the teacher’s behavior was at fault (you call on her for the hardest problems and your directions for homework are confusing.) The counselor intervened to acknowledge the parent’s eagerness for the situation to be resolved and to steer the session in a more productive direction, but the parent persisted by citing another reason the teacher was at fault. The teacher responded to defend himself and then added, “Perhaps something is bothering Joanie and she is distracted?” (Trying to find cause for problems is typical of a traditional problem-centered meeting.) At this point, the counselor intervened as follows to move the meeting from Part 1 (explore problems) to Part 2 (refocus on motivations for resolving the problems) [C = Counselor; P = Parent (Mrs. Johnson); S = Student (Joanie); T = Teacher (Mr. Smith)]:\\n',\n",

Because of the writing skills needed to complete this activity and the lack of personal communication between the counselor and individual participants, young children (elementary school age) may not be able to comprehend or complete what this procedure would require of them.

Before beginning the session, provide each participant with a 13-page handout that lists one step per page as described in Appendix C. Read each step aloud and allow time for participants to visualize their responses and write what they visualized on the handout. The activity takes approximately 40 to 45 minutes. The size of the group is not limited. This method has been found effective with small as well as large groups (Sklare et al., 2003).
