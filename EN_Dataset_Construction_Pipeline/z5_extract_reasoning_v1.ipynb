When I saw them they didn't want to talk, answered questions with only a \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no,\\\" and even though they were polite, it was obvious that they were angry at me and at the agency. I realized I wasn't getting anywhere, and not so long ago I would have panicked. But this time I just said that I could tell they were upset, and that others who had worries about how they were doing as parents sometimes felt that the agency was like an in-law who had come into the home to criticize how they were raising the baby. And did they open up! They had a lot of fears as to how to handle the situation now that their son was going to go to nursery school where people might know he was adopted, and they didn't know how to prepare him or if they should do so. They have a worker at the agency-at least they had one till she left last month-who was supposed to deal with such problems, but, it came out, they always felt on trial with her and didn't dare confess their worries. They were so relieved when I told them that their concerns were not unusual and were shared by most other adoptive parents.

As a rule the patient has agreed with my plan, relieved that the burden of the immediate future was no longer his responsibility. I am, of course, not talking about angry threats that patients make in therapy, or outside it, which are not meant to be carried out but are geared to upsetting the listener.

      "\"This intervention helped the client realize he was the one responsible for his success. Supporting and encouraging clients’ success with praise is called cheerleading. Students, in particular, love to be acknowledged for their accomplishments, especially those students in need of counseling. Their worlds are abundant with comments that stress what’s wrong with them. The same is often true for clients in non-school settings. Discovering what is right with clients and letting them know about it uplifts their outlook and boosts their self-esteem. Any instance of success or exception to problems, regardless of how small, warrants recognition. You can communicate cheerleading by the following means: Changing the tone of your voice to convey enthusiasm that shows how moved you are by clients’ efforts, Expressing excitement when a new behavior is attempted, Demonstrating that you are impressed with the maturity of clients’ thoughts or actions, Expressing amazement about clients’ creative thinking or decision making, Showing admiration for clients’ dedication and commitment to sticking with their new behaviors and not giving up, Be careful not to patronize clients when cheerleading. It’s essential that you truly mean what you say; otherwise, your comments will appear insincere, negating everything that has been accomplished in the interview. The cheerleading will come across as more sincere when the specific reason for the praise is included in the cheerleading response. Use the word because as a lead-in to the reason for the compliment, as shown in following examples of cheerleading: “Wow! How did you manage to do . . . because that showed courage.” “That’s terrific that you could . . . because that shows how mature you are.” “I’m really impressed with how you . . . because that indicates that you can make great decisions.” “How did you figure that out—because most kids your age couldn’t do that.” “Did you say you were only 11 years old? I’m impressed because you think like a 14-year-old.” “How were you able to come up with those thoughts—because most kids your age wouldn’t be able to think that clearly.” “That’s fantastic that you could remain calm under those circumstances, because most people would have lost it, but you didn’t.” Comments such as these reinforce successful attempts and encourage repeated efforts.\",\n",
