Either way, the therapist’s assumption of motivation was a necessary ingredient in his questions.\\n', 'This sequence lasts for less than three minutes and the Robert who comes into focus is an enthusiastic, confident, generous, and socially skilled boy. He is polite, cooperative, humorous, articulate, and extremely likeable, the sort of boy any teacher would be happy to join the class and any parent would be pleased to see their own children playing with. It is this Robert that Yasmin ‘chooses’ to work with rather than the Robert described in the referral letter, who was a boy close to permanent exclusion from school. In subsequent work, which extends over four sessions, Yasmin keeps the competent, collaborative Robert by her side and together they find his own unique pathway to a more rewarding and successful life at school.\\n', 'Here the process is straightforward. In answer to the therapist’s question, the client specifies three life differences that will fit with most therapists’ legitimate remit and which could, in most circumstances, be judged perfectly possible to achieve. Later in this section, we will examine what options the therapist might have when faced with more challenging responses to contract-seeking questions.\\n', 'By the time the client responds to this question, her outcome will be firmly rooted in an ‘in-life’ difference.\\n', 'As soon as the outcome is defined in terms of confidence coming back, getting out, and seeing people, there are many ways that this can be achieved, maybe through getting a job, maybe even without. The client’s chances of success have been enhanced through the disentangling of route and destination.\\n', 'Here the worker has taken the client’s wishes seriously, has been clear about his remit, and has moved to a ‘hope’ that is as close as possible to the client’s original response.\\n', 'In this example, within just a few questions the client is beginning the process of describing what she wants and all the practitioner had to do was to stay with the idea that the client chose to come even if it was not her idea.\\n', 'The practitioner will now build on this picture of required change and may well ask, ‘So, are you prepared to have a go at this even though you are not sure it is needed, in order to get your children back?’ If the client responds by saying ‘yes’, a response that is likely following this discussion, the work can proceed. What the practitioner must always remember is that what is important to the client is getting her children back from foster care and that the behavioural changes are only a means to that end.\\n', 'We can hear in this example the young person quite simply buying in to the adults’ ‘best hopes’. If, on the other hand, the young person had not bought-in, and had said ‘not really, there’s nothing wrong with me’, the solution focused practitioner can then ask, ‘Okay, you have come, you’re not bothered by this attitude thing that other people are going on about, so what would stop this being a complete and utter waste of your time?’ If then the young person responds by saying something along the lines of ‘getting adults off my back’, the therapist is in business again and the work has a direction.\\n', 'No-one would assume that this piece of work with Michael and his mother and his family is going to be easy, and indeed he may end up being accommodated, but once the request is defined in terms of the wished for changes rather than merely accommodation, it becomes obvious that there are many potential routes towards that and that accommodation is just one of those routes.\\n', 'It is not the therapist’s intention to promote the activity as described by the client. We cannot micro-manage our clients’ lives in this way. The aim is just to bring forth a realistic description of the sort of things that might happen. The purpose is to create a sense of possibility not to set behavioural tasks. When therapy is successful, the client will report behaviours like, but not the same as, those described.\\n', 'At the second session, a month later, James reports feeling much better, a change of job, and more of a social life. He also reported that his parents seemed to be getting on better with his dad helping out with his mother more. What is likely to have happened is that while James only saw his father as unhelpful, he felt he had to step in. The detailed description probably helped James realize that in his absence the father already did occasional things for his wife and this helped James off the hook.\\n', 'This short conversation illustrates the constructing with the client of a new narrative, a story that fits with the likelihood of further change. A small event, getting out of the house to collect her daughter, is gradually seen as being of greater and greater significance. In the next two chapters, we will look at some of the questions that support this shift.\\n', 'It is clear from this extract that at no point does the therapist argue with the client. The therapist accepts the client’s response and by asking ‘so what have you been pleased to notice about the way that you have been going about things, even though nothing is better?’, the client moves into detailing an alternative achievement and the conversation can then focus on what the client has done in the service of stabilization. Asking the client towards the end of the extract ‘how will you know when the time is right to take another step forward, to move things on again?’ builds the basis for a beautiful collaboration, paced at the client’s pace.\\n', 'The simple structure of this conversation is clear. The therapist interleaves the picture of change in such a way that after a while ‘cause and effect’ becomes blurred in a ‘chicken and egg’ manner. The question of who has to start the change is lost in the process and what becomes evident is that all that matters is that one member of the couple starts to ‘do something different’.\\n', 'In the bustling school environment, individual counselling or coaching sessions give students a precious space for calm reflection. SFBT offers an approach that fits perfectly with the requirement for a time-limited intervention where students don’t have to feel obligated to attend more than they feel is necessary. We have found that half an hour is ample time for a session and the majority of students appreciate the experience and wish to return for follow-up sessions. Other members of staff can participate as appropriate, and group sessions can also be run (see Chapter 79).\\n', 'Hamid went on to describe having a better relationship with friends and being saved the aggravation of ‘being in trouble’. These were outcomes he was willing to strive for even though to begin with the outcomes had been those desired by the school. In the end, as is usually the case in successful school counselling, both the student and the school were beneficiaries.\\n', 'Irrespective of the starting point – the school changing or Jasmine changing – as the interactional description unfolds, Jasmine’s motivation and commitment to change grow. Later she reports a change in her teacher’s behaviour.\\n', 'As the description develops, the client’s sense of possibility is likely to increase and she is likely to hear herself say things she might do that could promote the desired changes in her daughter’s behaviour. She will have given her own ‘advice’ and is thus more likely to take it.\\n', 'At her next appointment, Susan told the therapist she was very angry with him, saying ‘if it wasn’t for you I’d be dead and I’m really pissed off with you!’ This seemed like good news to the therapist, who said so and asked why he was getting the blame. Susan said she had woken up one day feeling worse than ever and without the will to live. She had once again prepared the bath, blades, and gin but at the last minute decided to ‘do’ the will to live even though she didn’t feel it. And once again she found herself having a cup of tea – the archetypal British response to crisis.\\n', 'With more laughter Josie goes on to list several more creatively orchestrated acts of courage.\\n', 'The following case demonstrates how the counselor’s persistence and patience eventually resulted in identification of a positive goal, a first step in SFBC. Mike, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, had recently transferred from a small, rural elementary school to a metropolitan middle school of more than 1,500 students. He was referred to me but did not seem to know why and, therefore, had no goal for counseling (C = Counselor; M = Mike):\\n', 'Counselors should start each meeting with a solution-focused question (for example, “As a result of us working together, how will we see Johnny doing better in school?”). Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.\\n', 'After allowing the parent and/or teacher to discuss problems for a few minutes, ask each of them these three questions: “Once this issue has been resolved, how will things be better for you and ____ (student)? What would you be doing differently? When are you doing some of those things now?” These questions shift the meeting from a problem focus to a solution focus. Parents and teachers begin to (1) detail what they would be doing or thinking if the problem were solved and then (2) do at least small parts of those actions, which often lead the student to change as well. This contrasts with the common scenario in which teachers or parents wait for a change in the student before changing themselves.\\n', 'This part of the SFPTC process requires you to use any and all of the solution-focused interventions described in this book—setting a positive goal, detailing, mindmapping, flagging the minefield, amplifying with reciprocal relationship questions, reframing, and refocusing—to promote future progress. Remember that goals must be detailed, represent an action or observable behavior (not the absence of a behavior), and be within the person’s control. For example, do not allow a parent to set a goal for the teacher and vice versa. Finally, each goal should clearly contribute to the “end game,” which is the student’s success. If time permits, solution-focused scaling may be useful at this point to help reinforce progress already made and detail future progress.\\n', 'Exploring the future without a change in the other.\\n', 'The shortest route is often the direct and straightforward one. We simply explain how we cannot change anyone else. For example:\\n', 'A woman came to me, Jane, because she habitually used cocaine. She reported that she would do $400 worth of cocaine almost every night. She wanted to stop. Through solution-focused questioning, it became clear that there were several periods during the week when she did not do cocaine.\\n', 'The second session was two and a half weeks later because the client had gone on vacation.\\n', 'A young man came to see us for fear of being fired from his job. He described an intense fear he had that people at his job thought he was stealing from work. He said he knew this because of the things being said to him and the way people looked at him. He had no idea why they thought he stole because he was a 100 percent honest person and would never do that. He felt hurt that they thought he stole and, therefore, he withdrew from interacting with them and kept to himself at work. His goal in coming to see us was initially stated as, “I am helpless in my job and I do not want to get fired from work.” (Not yet well-defined)\\n', 'A mother had called and wanted to talk about getting her daughter into therapy.\\n', 'A young married man called for therapy about problems in his four-year-old marriage, stating that he wanted to come in alone. His wife had insisted that he had the problem and that it was not up to her to make changes. He at least partially agreed with her that the problems were mostly his, and also he wanted to talk with someone alone, without her.\\n', '(The client may well need to be supported in exaggerating his response, but due to lack of space we’ll assume that support has been given.)\\n', '(It is important in such a reversal that the client does not remain in the same seat as this could lead to boundary confusion.)\\n', 'This reversal facilitated a diﬀerent and more immediate turn as the client asserted his authority. It is important to stay with the underlying process, the reason for the experiment, rather than missing the client by following a format.

They both saw Dorothy as quite optimistic in resolving their issues.

It is this Robert that Yasmin ‘chooses’ to work with rather than the Robert described in the referral letter, who was a boy close to permanent exclusion from school.

    "Here the process is straightforward. In answer to the therapist’s question, the client specifies three life differences that will fit with most therapists’ legitimate remit and which could, in most circumstances, be judged perfectly possible to achieve.

    "The practitioner will now build on this picture of required change and may well ask, ‘So, are you prepared to have a go at this even though you are not sure it is needed, in order to get your children back?’ If the client responds by saying ‘yes’, a response that is likely following this discussion, the work can proceed. What the practitioner must always remember is that what is important to the client is getting her children back from foster care and that the behavioural changes are only a means to that end.\n",

If, on the other hand, the young person had not bought-in, and had said ‘not really, there’s nothing wrong with me’, the solution focused practitioner can then ask, ‘Okay, you have come, you’re not bothered by this attitude thing that other people are going on about, so what would stop this being a complete and utter waste of your time?’ If then the young person responds by saying something along the lines of ‘getting adults off my back’, the therapist is in business again and the work has a direction.\n",

He also reported that his parents seemed to be getting on better with his dad helping out with his mother more.

Susan said she had woken up one day feeling worse than ever and without the will to live.

Mike, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, had recently transferred from a small, rural elementary school to a metropolitan middle school of more than 1,500 students. He was referred to me but did not seem to know why and, therefore, had no goal for counseling (C = Counselor; M = Mike):\n",

    "Counselors should start each meeting with a solution-focused question (for example, “As a result of us working together, how will we see Johnny doing better in school?”). Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "After allowing the parent and/or teacher to discuss problems for a few minutes, ask each of them these three questions: “Once this issue has been resolved, how will things be better for you and ____ (student)? What would you be doing differently? When are you doing some of those things now?” These questions shift the meeting from a problem focus to a solution focus. Parents and teachers begin to (1) detail what they would be doing or thinking if the problem were solved and then (2) do at least small parts of those actions, which often lead the student to change as well. This contrasts with the common scenario in which teachers or parents wait for a change in the student before changing themselves.\n",

    "This part of the SFPTC process requires you to use any and all of the solution-focused interventions described in this book—setting a positive goal, detailing, mindmapping, flagging the minefield, amplifying with reciprocal relationship questions, reframing, and refocusing—to promote future progress. Remember that goals must be detailed, represent an action or observable behavior (not the absence of a behavior), and be within the person’s control. For example, do not allow a parent to set a goal for the teacher and vice versa. Finally, each goal should clearly contribute to the “end game,” which is the student’s success. If time permits, solution-focused scaling may be useful at this point to help reinforce progress already made and detail future progress.\n",

She had once again prepared the bath, blades, and gin but at the last minute decided to ‘do’ the will to live even though she didn’t feel it.

Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.',\n",

They both saw Dorothy as quite optimistic in resolving their issues. However, although Dorothy predicted that Bob would be high also with a score of 8.5, the reality was that Bob saw himself rather low in optimism and gave him- self a score of 4. This is a rather large discrepancy in the partners’ levels of optimism. As their therapist, I would need to deal initially with this discrepancy and increase Bob’s optimism before moving forward in the therapeutic process.\\n',\n",

       " 'Whether Jessica actually had a good reason (in other words, was motivated) to come to the meeting or whether her ‘motivation’ was constructed through the conversational process is impossible to tell. Either way, the therapist’s assumption of motivation was a necessary ingredient in his questions.\\n',\n",
       " 'This sequence lasts for less than three minutes and the Robert who comes into focus is an enthusiastic, confident, generous, and socially skilled boy. He is polite, cooperative, humorous, articulate, and extremely likeable, the sort of boy any teacher would be happy to join the class and any parent would be pleased to see their own children playing with. It is this Robert that Yasmin ‘chooses’ to work with rather than the Robert described in the referral letter, who was a boy close to permanent exclusion from school. In subsequent work, which extends over four sessions, Yasmin keeps the competent, collaborative Robert by her side and together they find his own unique pathway to a more rewarding and successful life at school.\\n',\n",
       " 'Here the process is straightforward. In answer to the therapist’s question, the client specifies three life differences that will fit with most therapists’ legitimate remit and which could, in most circumstances, be judged perfectly possible to achieve. Later in this section, we will examine what options the therapist might have when faced with more challenging responses to contract-seeking questions.\\n',\n",
       " 'By the time the client responds to this question, her outcome will be firmly rooted in an ‘in-life’ difference.\\n',\n",
       " 'As soon as the outcome is defined in terms of confidence coming back, getting out, and seeing people, there are many ways that this can be achieved, maybe through getting a job, maybe even without. The client’s chances of success have been enhanced through the disentangling of route and destination.\\n',\n",
       " 'Here the worker has taken the client’s wishes seriously, has been clear about his remit, and has moved to a ‘hope’ that is as close as possible to the client’s original response.\\n',\n",
       " 'In this example, within just a few questions the client is beginning the process of describing what she wants and all the practitioner had to do was to stay with the idea that the client chose to come even if it was not her idea.\\n',\n",
       " 'The practitioner will now build on this picture of required change and may well ask, ‘So, are you prepared to have a go at this even though you are not sure it is needed, in order to get your children back?’ If the client responds by saying ‘yes’, a response that is likely following this discussion, the work can proceed. What the practitioner must always remember is that what is important to the client is getting her children back from foster care and that the behavioural changes are only a means to that end.\\n',\n",
       " 'We can hear in this example the young person quite simply buying in to the adults’ ‘best hopes’. If, on the other hand, the young person had not bought-in, and had said ‘not really, there’s nothing wrong with me’, the solution focused practitioner can then ask, ‘Okay, you have come, you’re not bothered by this attitude thing that other people are going on about, so what would stop this being a complete and utter waste of your time?’ If then the young person responds by saying something along the lines of ‘getting adults off my back’, the therapist is in business again and the work has a direction.\\n',\n",
       " 'No-one would assume that this piece of work with Michael and his mother and his family is going to be easy, and indeed he may end up being accommodated, but once the request is defined in terms of the wished for changes rather than merely accommodation, it becomes obvious that there are many potential routes towards that and that accommodation is just one of those routes.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is not the therapist’s intention to promote the activity as described by the client. We cannot micro-manage our clients’ lives in this way. The aim is just to bring forth a realistic description of the sort of things that might happen. The purpose is to create a sense of possibility not to set behavioural tasks. When therapy is successful, the client will report behaviours like, but not the same as, those described.\\n',\n",
       " 'At the second session, a month later, James reports feeling much better, a change of job, and more of a social life. He also reported that his parents seemed to be getting on better with his dad helping out with his mother more. What is likely to have happened is that while James only saw his father as unhelpful, he felt he had to step in. The detailed description probably helped James realize that in his absence the father already did occasional things for his wife and this helped James off the hook.\\n',\n",
       " 'This short conversation illustrates the constructing with the client of a new narrative, a story that fits with the likelihood of further change. A small event, getting out of the house to collect her daughter, is gradually seen as being of greater and greater significance. In the next two chapters, we will look at some of the questions that support this shift.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is clear from this extract that at no point does the therapist argue with the client. The therapist accepts the client’s response and by asking ‘so what have you been pleased to notice about the way that you have been going about things, even though nothing is better?’, the client moves into detailing an alternative achievement and the conversation can then focus on what the client has done in the service of stabilization. Asking the client towards the end of the extract ‘how will you know when the time is right to take another step forward, to move things on again?’ builds the basis for a beautiful collaboration, paced at the client’s pace.\\n',\n",
       " 'The simple structure of this conversation is clear. The therapist interleaves the picture of change in such a way that after a while ‘cause and effect’ becomes blurred in a ‘chicken and egg’ manner. The question of who has to start the change is lost in the process and what becomes evident is that all that matters is that one member of the couple starts to ‘do something different’.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the bustling school environment, individual counselling or coaching sessions give students a precious space for calm reflection. SFBT offers an approach that fits perfectly with the requirement for a time-limited intervention where students don’t have to feel obligated to attend more than they feel is necessary. We have found that half an hour is ample time for a session and the majority of students appreciate the experience and wish to return for follow-up sessions. Other members of staff can participate as appropriate, and group sessions can also be run (see Chapter 79).\\n',\n",
       " 'Hamid went on to describe having a better relationship with friends and being saved the aggravation of ‘being in trouble’. These were outcomes he was willing to strive for even though to begin with the outcomes had been those desired by the school. In the end, as is usually the case in successful school counselling, both the student and the school were beneficiaries.\\n',\n",
       " 'Irrespective of the starting point – the school changing or Jasmine changing – as the interactional description unfolds, Jasmine’s motivation and commitment to change grow. Later she reports a change in her teacher’s behaviour.\\n',\n",
       " 'As the description develops, the client’s sense of possibility is likely to increase and she is likely to hear herself say things she might do that could promote the desired changes in her daughter’s behaviour. She will have given her own ‘advice’ and is thus more likely to take it.\\n',\n",
       " 'At her next appointment, Susan told the therapist she was very angry with him, saying ‘if it wasn’t for you I’d be dead and I’m really pissed off with you!’ This seemed like good news to the therapist, who said so and asked why he was getting the blame. Susan said she had woken up one day feeling worse than ever and without the will to live. She had once again prepared the bath, blades, and gin but at the last minute decided to ‘do’ the will to live even though she didn’t feel it. And once again she found herself having a cup of tea – the archetypal British response to crisis.\\n',\n",

       " 'The following case demonstrates how the counselor’s persistence and patience eventually resulted in identification of a positive goal, a first step in SFBC. Mike, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, had recently transferred from a small, rural elementary school to a metropolitan middle school of more than 1,500 students. He was referred to me but did not seem to know why and, therefore, had no goal for counseling (C = Counselor; M = Mike):\\n',\n",
       " 'Counselors should start each meeting with a solution-focused question (for example, “As a result of us working together, how will we see Johnny doing better in school?”). Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.\\n',\n",
       " 'After allowing the parent and/or teacher to discuss problems for a few minutes, ask each of them these three questions: “Once this issue has been resolved, how will things be better for you and ____ (student)? What would you be doing differently? When are you doing some of those things now?” These questions shift the meeting from a problem focus to a solution focus. Parents and teachers begin to (1) detail what they would be doing or thinking if the problem were solved and then (2) do at least small parts of those actions, which often lead the student to change as well. This contrasts with the common scenario in which teachers or parents wait for a change in the student before changing themselves.\\n',\n",
       " 'This part of the SFPTC process requires you to use any and all of the solution-focused interventions described in this book—setting a positive goal, detailing, mindmapping, flagging the minefield, amplifying with reciprocal relationship questions, reframing, and refocusing—to promote future progress. Remember that goals must be detailed, represent an action or observable behavior (not the absence of a behavior), and be within the person’s control. For example, do not allow a parent to set a goal for the teacher and vice versa. Finally, each goal should clearly contribute to the “end game,” which is the student’s success. If time permits, solution-focused scaling may be useful at this point to help reinforce progress already made and detail future progress.\\n',\n",

       " 'The shortest route is often the direct and straightforward one. We simply explain how we cannot change anyone else. For example:\\n',\n",
       " 'A woman came to me, Jane, because she habitually used cocaine. She reported that she would do $400 worth of cocaine almost every night. She wanted to stop. Through solution-focused questioning, it became clear that there were several periods during the week when she did not do cocaine.\\n',\n",
       " 'The second session was two and a half weeks later because the client had gone on vacation.\\n',\n",
       " 'A young man came to see us for fear of being fired from his job. He described an intense fear he had that people at his job thought he was stealing from work. He said he knew this because of the things being said to him and the way people looked at him. He had no idea why they thought he stole because he was a 100 percent honest person and would never do that. He felt hurt that they thought he stole and, therefore, he withdrew from interacting with them and kept to himself at work. His goal in coming to see us was initially stated as, “I am helpless in my job and I do not want to get fired from work.” (Not yet well-defined)\\n',\n",
       " 'A mother had called and wanted to talk about getting her daughter into therapy.\\n',\n",
       " 'A young married man called for therapy about problems in his four-year-old marriage, stating that he wanted to come in alone. His wife had insisted that he had the problem and that it was not up to her to make changes. He at least partially agreed with her that the problems were mostly his, and also he wanted to talk with someone alone, without her.\\n',\n",
       " '(The client may well need to be supported in exaggerating his response, but due to lack of space we’ll assume that support has been given.)\\n',\n",
       " '(It is important in such a reversal that the client does not remain in the same seat as this could lead to boundary confusion.)\\n',\n",
       " 'This reversal facilitated a diﬀerent and more immediate turn as the client asserted his authority. It is important to stay with the underlying process, the reason for the experiment, rather than missing the client by following a format. The function of a gestalt experiment is to heighten awareness of what is. It may then lead to alternatives of what could be but not what should be. The example of an experiment given here is a highly graded experi- ment. In grading experiments we need to consider the dialectic of strangeness/familiarity and manage this in such a way as to sustain energy at the contact boundary. Grading experiments too highly by venturing too far along the continuum of the ego-alien will result in withdrawal and can shame the client.\\n']"

      "Whether Jessica actually had a good reason (in other words, was motivated) to come to the meeting or whether her ‘motivation’ was constructed through the conversational process is impossible to tell. Either way, the therapist’s assumption of motivation was a necessary ingredient in his questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sequence lasts for less than three minutes and the Robert who comes into focus is an enthusiastic, confident, generous, and socially skilled boy. He is polite, cooperative, humorous, articulate, and extremely likeable, the sort of boy any teacher would be happy to join the class and any parent would be pleased to see their own children playing with. It is this Robert that Yasmin ‘chooses’ to work with rather than the Robert described in the referral letter, who was a boy close to permanent exclusion from school. In subsequent work, which extends over four sessions, Yasmin keeps the competent, collaborative Robert by her side and together they find his own unique pathway to a more rewarding and successful life at school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the process is straightforward. In answer to the therapist’s question, the client specifies three life differences that will fit with most therapists’ legitimate remit and which could, in most circumstances, be judged perfectly possible to achieve. Later in this section, we will examine what options the therapist might have when faced with more challenging responses to contract-seeking questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the client responds to this question, her outcome will be firmly rooted in an ‘in-life’ difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the outcome is defined in terms of confidence coming back, getting out, and seeing people, there are many ways that this can be achieved, maybe through getting a job, maybe even without. The client’s chances of success have been enhanced through the disentangling of route and destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the worker has taken the client’s wishes seriously, has been clear about his remit, and has moved to a ‘hope’ that is as close as possible to the client’s original response.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, within just a few questions the client is beginning the process of describing what she wants and all the practitioner had to do was to stay with the idea that the client chose to come even if it was not her idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practitioner will now build on this picture of required change and may well ask, ‘So, are you prepared to have a go at this even though you are not sure it is needed, in order to get your children back?’ If the client responds by saying ‘yes’, a response that is likely following this discussion, the work can proceed. What the practitioner must always remember is that what is important to the client is getting her children back from foster care and that the behavioural changes are only a means to that end.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can hear in this example the young person quite simply buying in to the adults’ ‘best hopes’. If, on the other hand, the young person had not bought-in, and had said ‘not really, there’s nothing wrong with me’, the solution focused practitioner can then ask, ‘Okay, you have come, you’re not bothered by this attitude thing that other people are going on about, so what would stop this being a complete and utter waste of your time?’ If then the young person responds by saying something along the lines of ‘getting adults off my back’, the therapist is in business again and the work has a direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "No-one would assume that this piece of work with Michael and his mother and his family is going to be easy, and indeed he may end up being accommodated, but once the request is defined in terms of the wished for changes rather than merely accommodation, it becomes obvious that there are many potential routes towards that and that accommodation is just one of those routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the therapist’s intention to promote the activity as described by the client. We cannot micro-manage our clients’ lives in this way. The aim is just to bring forth a realistic description of the sort of things that might happen. The purpose is to create a sense of possibility not to set behavioural tasks. When therapy is successful, the client will report behaviours like, but not the same as, those described.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the second session, a month later, James reports feeling much better, a change of job, and more of a social life. He also reported that his parents seemed to be getting on better with his dad helping out with his mother more. What is likely to have happened is that while James only saw his father as unhelpful, he felt he had to step in. The detailed description probably helped James realize that in his absence the father already did occasional things for his wife and this helped James off the hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "This short conversation illustrates the constructing with the client of a new narrative, a story that fits with the likelihood of further change. A small event, getting out of the house to collect her daughter, is gradually seen as being of greater and greater significance. In the next two chapters, we will look at some of the questions that support this shift.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear from this extract that at no point does the therapist argue with the client. The therapist accepts the client’s response and by asking ‘so what have you been pleased to notice about the way that you have been going about things, even though nothing is better?’, the client moves into detailing an alternative achievement and the conversation can then focus on what the client has done in the service of stabilization. Asking the client towards the end of the extract ‘how will you know when the time is right to take another step forward, to move things on again?’ builds the basis for a beautiful collaboration, paced at the client’s pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple structure of this conversation is clear. The therapist interleaves the picture of change in such a way that after a while ‘cause and effect’ becomes blurred in a ‘chicken and egg’ manner. The question of who has to start the change is lost in the process and what becomes evident is that all that matters is that one member of the couple starts to ‘do something different’.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the bustling school environment, individual counselling or coaching sessions give students a precious space for calm reflection. SFBT offers an approach that fits perfectly with the requirement for a time-limited intervention where students don’t have to feel obligated to attend more than they feel is necessary. We have found that half an hour is ample time for a session and the majority of students appreciate the experience and wish to return for follow-up sessions. Other members of staff can participate as appropriate, and group sessions can also be run (see Chapter 79).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hamid went on to describe having a better relationship with friends and being saved the aggravation of ‘being in trouble’. These were outcomes he was willing to strive for even though to begin with the outcomes had been those desired by the school. In the end, as is usually the case in successful school counselling, both the student and the school were beneficiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irrespective of the starting point – the school changing or Jasmine changing – as the interactional description unfolds, Jasmine’s motivation and commitment to change grow. Later she reports a change in her teacher’s behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the description develops, the client’s sense of possibility is likely to increase and she is likely to hear herself say things she might do that could promote the desired changes in her daughter’s behaviour. She will have given her own ‘advice’ and is thus more likely to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At her next appointment, Susan told the therapist she was very angry with him, saying ‘if it wasn’t for you I’d be dead and I’m really pissed off with you!’ This seemed like good news to the therapist, who said so and asked why he was getting the blame. Susan said she had woken up one day feeling worse than ever and without the will to live. She had once again prepared the bath, blades, and gin but at the last minute decided to ‘do’ the will to live even though she didn’t feel it. And once again she found herself having a cup of tea – the archetypal British response to crisis.\n",

      "The following case demonstrates how the counselor’s persistence and patience eventually resulted in identification of a positive goal, a first step in SFBC. Mike, an 11-year-old sixth-grader, had recently transferred from a small, rural elementary school to a metropolitan middle school of more than 1,500 students. He was referred to me but did not seem to know why and, therefore, had no goal for counseling (C = Counselor; M = Mike):\n",
      "\n",
      "Counselors should start each meeting with a solution-focused question (for example, “As a result of us working together, how will we see Johnny doing better in school?”). Dr. Sabella notes that it can be difficult to get parents and teachers to talk more about what they do want for the student instead of what they don’t want. He notes that it can be equally challenging to get each party to talk about their own actions instead of the actions of others. He has found that allowing a few minutes of problem-centered discussion can be cathartic and, as a result, can diffuse anger and reduce defensiveness. The “problem talk” can be acceptable as long as the counselor keeps his or her “solution-focused ears” on and steers the group toward “solution talk” as the conference continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "After allowing the parent and/or teacher to discuss problems for a few minutes, ask each of them these three questions: “Once this issue has been resolved, how will things be better for you and ____ (student)? What would you be doing differently? When are you doing some of those things now?” These questions shift the meeting from a problem focus to a solution focus. Parents and teachers begin to (1) detail what they would be doing or thinking if the problem were solved and then (2) do at least small parts of those actions, which often lead the student to change as well. This contrasts with the common scenario in which teachers or parents wait for a change in the student before changing themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This part of the SFPTC process requires you to use any and all of the solution-focused interventions described in this book—setting a positive goal, detailing, mindmapping, flagging the minefield, amplifying with reciprocal relationship questions, reframing, and refocusing—to promote future progress. Remember that goals must be detailed, represent an action or observable behavior (not the absence of a behavior), and be within the person’s control. For example, do not allow a parent to set a goal for the teacher and vice versa. Finally, each goal should clearly contribute to the “end game,” which is the student’s success. If time permits, solution-focused scaling may be useful at this point to help reinforce progress already made and detail future progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exploring the future without a change in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shortest route is often the direct and straightforward one. We simply explain how we cannot change anyone else. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman came to me, Jane, because she habitually used cocaine. She reported that she would do $400 worth of cocaine almost every night. She wanted to stop. Through solution-focused questioning, it became clear that there were several periods during the week when she did not do cocaine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second session was two and a half weeks later because the client had gone on vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A young man came to see us for fear of being fired from his job. He described an intense fear he had that people at his job thought he was stealing from work. He said he knew this because of the things being said to him and the way people looked at him. He had no idea why they thought he stole because he was a 100 percent honest person and would never do that. He felt hurt that they thought he stole and, therefore, he withdrew from interacting with them and kept to himself at work. His goal in coming to see us was initially stated as, “I am helpless in my job and I do not want to get fired from work.” (Not yet well-defined)\n",
      "\n",
      "A mother had called and wanted to talk about getting her daughter into therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A young married man called for therapy about problems in his four-year-old marriage, stating that he wanted to come in alone. His wife had insisted that he had the problem and that it was not up to her to make changes. He at least partially agreed with her that the problems were mostly his, and also he wanted to talk with someone alone, without her.\n",
      "\n",
      "(The client may well need to be supported in exaggerating his response, but due to lack of space we’ll assume that support has been given.)\n",
      "\n",
      "(It is important in such a reversal that the client does not remain in the same seat as this could lead to boundary confusion.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This reversal facilitated a diﬀerent and more immediate turn as the client asserted his authority. It is important to stay with the underlying process, the reason for the experiment, rather than missing the client by following a format. The function of a gestalt experiment is to heighten awareness of what is. It may then lead to alternatives of what could be but not what should be. The example of an experiment given here is a highly graded experi- ment. In grading experiments we need to consider the dialectic of strangeness/familiarity and manage this in such a way as to sustain energy at the contact boundary. Grading experiments too highly by venturing too far along the continuum of the ego-alien will result in withdrawal and can shame the client.\n",
