Other members of staff can participate as appropriate, and group sessions can also be run (see Chapter 79).\\n': 1,\n",

I know nothing really bad is going to happen to me’), or he may have thought something ‘terrible’ was going to happen and quickly left the situation but now cannot specify what the terrible event was that he believed would occur.

The therapist needs to keep clients on their toes by asking them to define their terms instead of letting them assume the meaning of the terms is mutually understood and agreed. However, it is important that therapists do not become ‘meaning maniacs’, i.e. asking their clients what they mean by the terms that they use and then asking for the meaning of the new terms that the clients use to explain the old terms … and so on as this will develop into an infinite regress of meaning about meaning.

Are there any questions you have for me? If not, I need to take a few minutes to review our meeting so I can write you a message that you can take with you. As I’m doing that why don’t you write me a note about what you got out of our meeting (you can ask younger children to draw a picture of what they will be doing when things are better). Then we can share our notes with each other before we finish our meeting. Some counselors take short cuts in the model by eliminating the message to the client. However, as mentioned previously, you are likely to achieve greater success with SFBC when you include the message segment of the process. Writing a message reinforces the client’s successes, encourages follow-through, and provides a tangible reminder of the client’s strengths and resources.

       "  'pre_reasoning': 'Clients returning for second or subsequent interviews already have been assigned to continue doing things that are working or to notice what’s better in their lives. Follow-up meetings begin with the premise that clients have continued this focus between sessions and have observed improvements. I have found that most clients report positive changes, and those who report that no progress occurred do, with further solution-focused exploration, identify at least minimal change. Because the SFBC approach emphasizes assets, clients are more likely to report that things are better since the previous meeting.This chapter provides a detailed description of how to conduct second and subsequent sessions. The sequence of interventions described in this chapter is used for all second and subsequent sessions, whether the session follows an initial session that used the full SFBC format described in Chapters 1 and 2 or the abbreviated SFBC format described in Chapter 5. Topics include a recommendation for how to start the session, the EARS process (Elicit, Amplify, Reinforce, Start over), tips for using scaling in subsequent sessions, suggestions for assessing further need for counseling, a flow chart and note sheet for use with subsequent meetings, and summaries of subsequent sessions with an actual case.Subsequent Sessions: Getting StartedAfter you have greeted the client, begin the second or subsequent session by explaining that you will spend some time talking about how things are going, and that you will end the session with writing messages to each other. Then open the discussion with a review of the client’s goal.Components of Second and Subsequent SessionsFollowing a well-organized process is just as important for subsequent meetings as it is for the first meeting. This section of the chapter describes the step-by-step process and recommended interventions for second and subsequent meetings with clients. Many of the interventions, such as detailing, cheerleading, mindmapping, microscoping, reciprocal relationship questions, what else questions, and writing a message, will be familiar because they are the same or variations of the techniques used in the initial session.Subsequent sessions—whether the second session or later meetings—comprise these components: Asking what is better or different; using the EARS process to solicit and reinforce what is better; scaling; assessing, if appropriate, whether additional sessions are needed; and writing a message.Ask “What’s Better?”After you have greeted the client, restated the goal for counseling, and introduced what will occur in the session, ask this simple question: “What’s better since we last met?” Typically clients will respond in one of four ways: (1) things are better; (2) things are the same; (3) things are worse; or (4) things are different but not better. There is overlap among the interventions you can use for these four categories; however, to provide a “how-to” guide for handling each type of response, each is covered in a separate section.When Clients Report Things Are BetterIn my experience, the most common response is that things are better. Just as in the initial session, your role then is to elicit details about how the client brought about the positive change and reinforce or cheerlead these productive thoughts or behaviors. For second and subsequence sessions, the SFBC model accomplishes this using a sequence known as EARS (Berg, 1994), which is an acronym for the following series of steps:Elicit the details of what’s better.Amplify the effects of what’s better using reciprocal relationship questions.Reinforce how the client made things better, andStart the sequence over again to see what else is better.This resembles the initial session when you detail instances of success in relation to the client’s goal. After clients tell you what is better since the last meeting, elicit details by asking, “How are things better?” or “What have you done to make things better.”The amplifying component of EARS investigates the ripple effect as changes in the client’s behavior prompt others to respond more positively to the client. Elaborating on the reciprocity evoked by clients’ efforts empowers them to recognize the impact of their actions, which in turn reinforces clients to take on further challenges they may not have attempted otherwise. This component uses reciprocal relationship questions as described in Chapter 2. At the close of the second counseling session, a fifth-grade boy in a behavior disorder class made the following comment that highlights the powerful impact of amplifying success:I like coming here because everywhere else I don’t get a chance to talk to anyone about all the good things I do and how my friends and teacher act with me when I do these good things. That helps me even do more good stuff.Reinforcing or cheerleading, which is the third step in the sequence, is already familiar to most counselors. As noted in earlier chapters, as clients discover and are supported in their efforts to achieve positive change in their lives, mindmaps form to guide them in future situations. Because this part of the interview resembles the instances of success and cheerleading sections in Chapter 3, those techniques are not reviewed again here.Start the sequence again:Repeat the process several times by asking what else is better and using EARS to elicit details, amplify reciprocal relationships, and reinforce positive steps the client has taken.If clients have difficulty recalling a time when things were a little bit better, microscoping can be useful. As described in Chapter 3, with this technique you inquire about segments of time (for example, the past several days, yesterday, today, or in the past hour) when things may have been a little better. This often helps clients recall moments of success.',\n",

When this occurs, ask, “How come things aren’t worse than they are?” Clients’ responses help determine how they prevented things from falling apart completely. During this exchange, “listen for better.” In other words, listen for any indication that things are better, even if just slightly. Use interventions that help clients recognize the coping skills they have used to keep their situations from deteriorating even further. Identifying how clients are coping suggests solutions. Capitalizing on instances of success—no matter how slight—in the midst of slippages can turn unpleasant experiences into moments of hope. Once instances of success or coping skills have been identified, proceed with the EARS process described previously. The following sequence of questions can be used when clients report that things are worse:“Were things bad every minute of every day all week?”“Tell me about a time when things were not quite as bad as other times.”“What was going on with you when things weren’t quite as bad?”“How were you different when it wasn’t quite as bad?”The following example is taken from an actual case of a 12-year-old girl referred to counseling for problems controlling her temper.

When I finally called them, they were very negativistic, but I finally got them to agree to come in. When I saw them they didn\\'t want to talk, answered questions with only a \"yes\" or \"no,\" and even though they were polite, it was obvious that they were angry at me and at the agency. I realized I wasn\\'t getting anywhere, and not so long ago I would have panicked. But this time I just said that I could tell they were upset, and that others who had worries about how they were doing as parents sometimes felt that the agency was like an in-law who had come into the home to criticize how they were raising the baby. And did they open up! They had a lot of fears as to how to handle the situation now that their son was going to go to nursery school where people might know he was adopted, and they didn\\'t know how to prepare him or if they should do so. They have a worker at the agency-at least they had one till she left last month-who was supposed to deal with such problems, but, it came out, they always felt on trial with her and didn\\'t dare confess their worries. They were so relieved when I told them that their concerns were not unusual and were shared by most other adoptive parents. They were so grateful to me, even though I didn\\'t really do all that much for them.',\n",

       "  'post_reasoning': 'Why does the patient delay-and almost omit-telling the therapist her good news about being given clinical responsibilities at the agency? Two possibilities suggest themselves: (1) The excitement of her achievement is so stimulating that she cannot handle it comfortably until the end of the session when she can report it without having to discuss it at length. Patients often leave the most important developments to the end of a session for this reason-not deliberately but owing to a temporary, unconscious defensive perceptual gap. (2) The patient may fear that the therapist will not appreciate the significance of her achievement and will, by his lack of response, leave her painfully ashamed of her own excitement. By postponing the telling to the last possible moment, she symbolically minimizes what she is about to say and prepares herself to make a quick exit-maneuvers to ameliorate the hurt she anticipates.\\nThe therapist in this case handles both possibilities by his sincere expression of pleasure in her accomplishment and, by implication, in the victory it represents over the anxieties that have frequently prevented her from making the most of her opportunities and abilities. With a patient who had achieved greater insight and objectivity about himself, the therapist, though pleased for him, might well have remained noncommittal, only interpreting the patient\\'s tension and asking him to examine it when the matter came up-as it surely would come up in some form-in the next session. In Miss Banks\\'s situation he chose (I think correctly) to gratify her need reasonably and directly. This difference in approach is often mistakenly couched in terms of whether otte is being \"human\" with a patient: the implication is that the therapist, in gratifying the patient, abandons the therapeutic posture. However, Miss Banks\\'s therapist is not being \"nice\" to her as opposed to being \"therapeutic.\" In taking her need at face value, he makes a calculated move in the treatment.\\nBy the same token, there is nothing inhuman or inhumane about abstaining from gratifying a patient\\'s immediate needs if the abstention is in the interest of the therapeutic goal; and if the therapist believes not only that the patient can tolerate the resulting tension, but that the treatment will benefit because optimal anxiety thus generated may enable the patient to mobilize pertinent material. The needs of the treatment-rather than the therapist\\'s consideration of what kind of a person he will seem to be to the patient at the moment-should determine what he says or does not say.\\nFrom here on, the sessions with Miss Banks had a spontaneity and rhythm that was not present at the outset of the therapy. There was noticeably less need for the therapist to guide the hour and move it along.\\n'},\n",

Often there is little tolerance for what is deemed evil and unnatural in such families, and the child finds it necessary to reject a part of herself. In Miss Delmore's case I would suspect that the absence of her parents during this crucial period of development made it all the more difficult for her to deal with phantasies that could then develop without being checked by the ameliorating reality that contact with her parents-the persons who were the targets of her sexual drive-would have brought.

My answer is truthful, but I am interested not so much in clarifying my position as in addressing the underlying question that I feel he is asking. He seems satisfied with my response, and I let it go at that.

This focusing on the exceptions with “responsibility” and “capability” presuppositions is a subtle deconstruction of the limits of her beliefs and an opening up of new meaning. The old belief may have been that she could work on her homework only if she was interested in it first. Later, she reversed that belief as she saw that as she moved herself to work on her homework, she developed interest. The belief that she had to feel something first before she could do what she wanted was reversed to a new belief—that she could gain a new feeling by taking action first. Another belief the client held may have been that she had to be as smart as her sister in order to do what she wanted. At the same time that this was accepted, we asked how she does the exception, given that it is not as easy for her as it is for her sister.

       "  'post_reasoning': 'Gradually the descriptions of life after the miracle lead to questions focusing on whether the different behavior that results (in this case, behaving friendly toward her son) could happen or has already happened at some point in the relationship. If so (this is most often the case), the questions then move in the direction of identifying “when and how” this happens.As exemplified by Margaret’s case, when we encounter this sort of answer to the miracle question, we typically start by accepting the client’s description of how the family member becomes different. We then move into asking about how the person who wants the change in his or her family member becomes different as a result of the other person changing. Finally, we ask questions that explore how the interactions change between the people involved.In short, when working with the “Family Members Become Different” answer, there are usually two phases. The first phase involves asking questions that lead to a description of how the miracle changes the other person. The second phase (which is actually a continuation of the dialogue that began in the first phase) focuses on questions that result in a description of how the relationship between the two people will change, and how this in turn will eventually affect the client who originally wanted the other person to change.This example also serves to further emphasize one of the key elements of the miracle question that we consider especially crucial: the necessity of developing a richly detailed description of the miracle that is solidly based on the client’s real, everyday life. Together with the client and the family we try to create an image of the future in which the problems do not exist and the things that the family wants to have happen do so in such a detailed way that it begins to feel almost as if they have already happened. This is particularly important with families and individuals who have been beaten up by life and are in desperate need of an experience in the therapy room that gives them sufficient courage and hope for the hard work involved in making the solution they envision a concrete reality. For this purpose, we try to create an image of the solution, i.e., life after the miracle, that contains as many concrete details as possible, and we try to “travel” in the miracle picture. We create and we live the miracle with descriptions of emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and interactions with other people. The following case will illustrate this idea.'},\n",

Answers to any and all of these questions contain useful information. Clients will often describe why they made changes when the therapist asks what is different and will frequently answer with “what is different” when the therapist asks “How did you do that?” Clients will sometimes spontaneously tell the therapist why they decided to make a certain change. Once again, it is important to listen to the client’s answer so you know what question you asked. The Miracle Question and the Following Sessions: Typically the therapist will start the session by asking, “What’s better?” and after eliciting some details he or she will ask where the client puts himself or herself on the scale. Some therapists will start the session with the scale and some therapists will start the session saying something such as: “Things go up and down; sometimes it’s a bit better, then it’s worse, then it goes up again. So, what is the highest and lowest you’ve been on the scale since we met last, with 10 standing for the day after the miracle?” The client answers with highest and lowest and the therapist then asks what was different when the client was higher on the scale and how the client made it happen. The therapist will also normally ask where best friend, Wife, children, etc. would put the client on the scale and what the client thinks they have seen that makes them put him or her there. Most often clients will be able to describe a number of things that are better in different areas of their life, how they felt better, what they did that was a sign or expression of “better,” and how other people were different toward them then. The therapist can ask if these things are new, and will usually ask for the client’s explanation about how these changes happened (Who did what that was helpful?). Sometimes clients will be able to describe what they did that made a difference and how, and sometimes clients will respond like Victoria did while explaining how she got herself to go to school every day after the first session: “I have no idea. I have just gone nuts.” A rather typical exchange in the beginning of a second session will be the following.'},\n",

But Robert’s description of things being better is linked to a state that he literally feels inside his stomach. Oftentimes the problem with exceptions like this that are essentially feeling states, is that they are internal, not external. As Robert says here, his friends would not notice. Fortunately, Mom would notice. How do you decide what to do next in situations such as this where the client answers “I don’t know” and both client and observer have described the solution as “feeling better”? Usually feeling state questions do not lead to anything that is externally reinforceable, so I hesitated to focus on feeling better. In the early part of the session it came up as feeling “less” pain and then it came up as “not feeling pain,” and the session began to shift. “It doesn’t ache” is a very different statement than “It would ache less.” After questions following up on what would be happening when it doesn’t ache, the client became more animated and intrigued. The description of the absence of pain made room for the therapist to ask what would be happening instead—the presence of something else instead of the pain— and thereby a description of the solution. Then it follows that the Mother and brothers would notice this, and so you do have some external indicators, reinforcers.'},\n",
