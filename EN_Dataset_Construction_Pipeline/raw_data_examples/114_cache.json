This technique makes complex aspects of the client's life more tangible and accessible. By scaling the miracle, the client can recognize progress already made and consider the changes necessary for success. It also highlights that achieving the entire miracle is not necessary for success, emphasizing progress and self-defined improvement.", "topic_dialog": {"key": "fewshot", "method": "Solution-Focused Brief Therapy", "dialog": [{"id": "114-0", "participant": "Therapist", "text": "Excellent.

By complimenting the student on her bravery and progress towards her 'miracle,' the therapist reinforces positive changes and sets a task for the student to notice when she is doing better. This task aims to boost the student's confidence, help her identify behaviors for replication, and increase positive experiences by focusing on moments of improvement."}
