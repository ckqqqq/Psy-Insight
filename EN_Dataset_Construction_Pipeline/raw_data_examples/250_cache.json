Each therapy session is viewed as a distinct entity with specific issues to address. By directly engaging with transference feelings, the therapist demonstrates readiness to explore deeper insights. The accuracy of interpretations is not solely based on patient agreement. Alternative approaches may involve gradual introduction of transference interpretations. Directly addressing fears and negative perceptions can help establish a secure therapeutic environment for the patient to express emotions and fears."}
