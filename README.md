## 💡 Introduction

Psy-Insight is a bilingual, interpretable multi-task dataset for psychological counseling dialogues, designed to support the application of large language models in mental health. The dataset comprises 6,208 rounds of multi-turn counseling dialogues across 520 topics in English (and 4,310 topics with 5,776 rounds in Chinese). Each dialogue round is annotated with step-by-step reasoning labels and multi-task labels. These include emotional labels (e.g., happy), psychological treatment method labels (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT), strategy labels (e.g., question), and step-by-step reasoning annotations (e.g., background introduction to a dialogue topic, session summary, counselor reasoning, etc.). Psy-Insight's design is not only suitable for tasks such as emotion classification and psychological treatment interpretation but also for multi-task instruction fine-tuning of large language models.

## 📊 Data Example

A counseling cycle for a client consists of several sessions. In each session, the counselor and the client engage in multiple turns of conversation around a specific theme or goal. We annotate these two dialogue granularities with short labels and COT annotations.
