# Psy-Insight

Psy-Insight is a bilingual, interpretable multi-task dataset for psychological counseling dialogues, designed to support the application of large language models in mental health. The dataset comprises 6,208 rounds of multi-turn counseling dialogues across 520 topics in English (and 4,310 topics with 5,776 rounds in Chinese). Each dialogue round is annotated with step-by-step reasoning labels and multi-task labels. These include emotional labels (e.g., happy), psychological treatment method labels (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT), strategy labels (e.g., question), and step-by-step reasoning annotations (e.g., background introduction to a dialogue topic, session summary, counselor reasoning, etc.). Psy-Insight's design is not only suitable for tasks such as emotion classification and psychological treatment interpretation but also for multi-task instruction fine-tuning of large language models.
