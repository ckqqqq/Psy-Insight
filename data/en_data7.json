Is there any truth in what I’ve said?’ Situational exposure occurs when clients agree to face the feared situations they usually avoid in order to elicit their hot thoughts. In the safety of the counselling room the client may find it difficult to gain access to such thoughts because he is obviously not in the situation which triggers them, he may play down the distressing nature of the thoughts (e.g. ‘I’m being silly really. I know nothing really bad is going to happen to me’), or he may have thought something ‘terrible’ was going to happen and quickly left the situation but now cannot specify what the terrible event was that he believed would occur. By encouraging clients to enter into feared or avoided situations, their hot thoughts can be activated. For example, a client who is afraid of eating in public but cannot say why is accompanied to a local café by the therapist.",

Accompanying clients on such trips early in therapy is often necessary as they are hardly likely at this stage to carry out such feared trips alone in order to record their thoughts. This is used when clients have difficulty revealing key thoughts in their problematic relations with others. The therapist can play the person with whom the client experiences interpersonal difficulties. It is important that the therapist takes on the characteristics that the client ascribes to the other person if the role play is to have any verisimilitude (e.g. if the client says that a work colleague is rude and abrupt then the therapist should not play this person as polite and considerate as this will undermine the role play). In the following example, the therapist plays the role of the client’s friend who is always critical of him and orders him around. The client wants to know why he puts up with such behaviour from his supposed friend."

By encouraging clients to weigh evidence and consider alternative interpretations, therapists facilitate cognitive restructuring and promote more realistic thinking patterns. This approach helps clients to align their thoughts with external events and experience better mental health by reducing distorted thinking and associated emotional distress."

Using words like ‘failure’, ‘useless’, ‘worthless’ or ‘no good’ to define oneself are not only dangerous overgeneralizations but are hopelessly inadequate and inaccurate in capturing the complexity and uniqueness of the self. Semantic precision helps clients to be clear and accurate about events and what can be done about them instead of focusing on what they believe they are which will prevent them learning from their mistakes and restricting their self-development. The therapist needs to keep clients on their toes by asking them to define their terms instead of letting them assume the meaning of the terms is mutually understood and agreed. However, it is important that therapists do not become ‘meaning maniacs’, i.e. asking their clients what they mean by the terms that they use and then asking for the meaning of the new terms that the clients use to explain the old terms … and so on as this will develop into an infinite regress of meaning about meaning. This process will exhaust both therapist and client without reaching any helpful conclusions about which terms are meaningful in discussing problems and which are meaningless. Defining terms is not an end in itself: it is a means of establishing semantic clarity so that a more informed discussion of these terms can be undertaken."

By asking detailed, future-oriented questions, the therapist helped Shawn to 'see' and describe a preferred reality, which in turn elicited positive emotions and a sense of normalcy regarding the changes he wishes to implement. The therapist's observations of Shawn's mood shifts and his increasing comfort with the idea of change reflect the effectiveness of SFBT. The therapist's approach of providing feedback that aligned with Shawn's own words and offering suggestions for simple, autonomy-respecting tasks to notice changes further empowered Shawn to take steps towards his goals. This session demonstrates the power of SFBT in fostering client resilience and hope, and encourages the continuation of this therapeutic approach in future sessions."

In such cases, practitioners may need to provide direct advice instead of relying solely on the client's knowledge.

This question helps clients create a mental picture of success, leading to concrete examples of achievement. The miracle question was developed by de Shazer to establish clear goals effectively and has become a key tool in solution-focused counseling. Alternative versions of the miracle question, tailored to different client groups, can also be impactful in goal-setting and problem-solving. Regardless of the formulation, documenting client responses to the miracle question is crucial for session follow-up and progress tracking."

As I’m doing that why don’t you write me a note about what you got out of our meeting (you can ask younger children to draw a picture of what they will be doing when things are better). Then we can share our notes with each other before we finish our meeting. Some counselors take short cuts in the model by eliminating the message to the client. However, as mentioned previously, you are likely to achieve greater success with SFBC when you include the message segment of the process. Writing a message reinforces the client’s successes, encourages follow-through, and provides a tangible reminder of the client’s strengths and resources. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of constructing a message for the client."

        "reasoning": "Clients returning for second or subsequent interviews already have been assigned to continue doing things that are working or to notice what’s better in their lives. Follow-up meetings begin with the premise that clients have continued this focus between sessions and have observed improvements. I have found that most clients report positive changes, and those who report that no progress occurred do, with further solution-focused exploration, identify at least minimal change. Because the SFBC approach emphasizes assets, clients are more likely to report that things are better since the previous meeting.This chapter provides a detailed description of how to conduct second and subsequent sessions. The sequence of interventions described in this chapter is used for all second and subsequent sessions, whether the session follows an initial session that used the full SFBC format described in Chapters 1 and 2 or the abbreviated SFBC format described in Chapter 5. Topics include a recommendation for how to start the session, the EARS process (Elicit, Amplify, Reinforce, Start over), tips for using scaling in subsequent sessions, suggestions for assessing further need for counseling, a flow chart and note sheet for use with subsequent meetings, and summaries of subsequent sessions with an actual case.Subsequent Sessions: Getting StartedAfter you have greeted the client, begin the second or subsequent session by explaining that you will spend some time talking about how things are going, and that you will end the session with writing messages to each other. Then open the discussion with a review of the client’s goal.Components of Second and Subsequent SessionsFollowing a well-organized process is just as important for subsequent meetings as it is for the first meeting. This section of the chapter describes the step-by-step process and recommended interventions for second and subsequent meetings with clients. Many of the interventions, such as detailing, cheerleading, mindmapping, microscoping, reciprocal relationship questions, what else questions, and writing a message, will be familiar because they are the same or variations of the techniques used in the initial session.Subsequent sessions—whether the second session or later meetings—comprise these components: Asking what is better or different; using the EARS process to solicit and reinforce what is better; scaling; assessing, if appropriate, whether additional sessions are needed; and writing a message.Ask “What’s Better?”After you have greeted the client, restated the goal for counseling, and introduced what will occur in the session, ask this simple question: “What’s better since we last met?” Typically clients will respond in one of four ways: (1) things are better; (2) things are the same; (3) things are worse; or (4) things are different but not better. There is overlap among the interventions you can use for these four categories; however, to provide a “how-to” guide for handling each type of response, each is covered in a separate section.When Clients Report Things Are BetterIn my experience, the most common response is that things are better. Just as in the initial session, your role then is to elicit details about how the client brought about the positive change and reinforce or cheerlead these productive thoughts or behaviors. For second and subsequence sessions, the SFBC model accomplishes this using a sequence known as EARS (Berg, 1994), which is an acronym for the following series of steps:Elicit the details of what’s better.Amplify the effects of what’s better using reciprocal relationship questions.Reinforce how the client made things better, andStart the sequence over again to see what else is better.This resembles the initial session when you detail instances of success in relation to the client’s goal. After clients tell you what is better since the last meeting, elicit details by asking, “How are things better?” or “What have you done to make things better.”The amplifying component of EARS investigates the ripple effect as changes in the client’s behavior prompt others to respond more positively to the client. Elaborating on the reciprocity evoked by clients’ efforts empowers them to recognize the impact of their actions, which in turn reinforces clients to take on further challenges they may not have attempted otherwise. This component uses reciprocal relationship questions as described in Chapter 2. At the close of the second counseling session, a fifth-grade boy in a behavior disorder class made the following comment that highlights the powerful impact of amplifying success:I like coming here because everywhere else I don’t get a chance to talk to anyone about all the good things I do and how my friends and teacher act with me when I do these good things. That helps me even do more good stuff.Reinforcing or cheerleading, which is the third step in the sequence, is already familiar to most counselors. As noted in earlier chapters, as clients discover and are supported in their efforts to achieve positive change in their lives, mindmaps form to guide them in future situations. Because this part of the interview resembles the instances of success and cheerleading sections in Chapter 3, those techniques are not reviewed again here.Start the sequence again:Repeat the process several times by asking what else is better and using EARS to elicit details, amplify reciprocal relationships, and reinforce positive steps the client has taken.If clients have difficulty recalling a time when things were a little bit better, microscoping can be useful. As described in Chapter 3, with this technique you inquire about segments of time (for example, the past several days, yesterday, today, or in the past hour) when things may have been a little better. This often helps clients recall moments of success.",

        "summary": "When Clients Report Things Are WorseClients may indicate that things are worse than they reported in the previous meeting. When this occurs, ask, “How come things aren’t worse than they are?” Clients’ responses help determine how they prevented things from falling apart completely. During this exchange, “listen for better.” In other words, listen for any indication that things are better, even if just slightly. Use interventions that help clients recognize the coping skills they have used to keep their situations from deteriorating even further. Identifying how clients are coping suggests solutions. Capitalizing on instances of success—no matter how slight—in the midst of slippages can turn unpleasant experiences into moments of hope. Once instances of success or coping skills have been identified, proceed with the EARS process described previously. The following sequence of questions can be used when clients report that things are worse:“Were things bad every minute of every day all week?”“Tell me about a time when things were not quite as bad as other times.”“What was going on with you when things weren’t quite as bad?”“How were you different when it wasn’t quite as bad?”The following example is taken from an actual case of a 12-year-old girl referred to counseling for problems controlling her temper. This excerpt shows how “listening for better” led the client to recognize a tool she could use to help her reach her goal (C= Counselor; Cl= Client):"

Calling your buddies by their names, talking to them instead of pushing them around, and playing with them work to keep things peaceful. You also realize that you would be happier if you were to get up on your own in the morning, say hello to everyone in your family after waking up, help your mom cook dinner, and treat the members of your family like you treat your friends. If you were to do these things you think they would be nicer to you in return. I am really impressed with your ability to tell yourself to “Be nice and don’t hurt anybody” 25 to 50 times in your mind to avoid trouble. Your ability to think about the consequences of doing things that will get you in trouble, like sneaking out of the house, shows that you respect yourself, your mother, your father, and your friends and also says you don’t want to disappoint them. Because of your desire to improve your relationships with your friends and your family, I would like you to"

When I finally called them, they were very negativistic, but I finally got them to agree to come in. When I saw them they didn't want to talk, answered questions with only a \"yes\" or \"no,\" and even though they were polite, it was obvious that they were angry at me and at the agency. I realized I wasn't getting anywhere, and not so long ago I would have panicked. But this time I just said that I could tell they were upset, and that others who had worries about how they were doing as parents sometimes felt that the agency was like an in-law who had come into the home to criticize how they were raising the baby. And did they open up! They had a lot of fears as to how to handle the situation now that their son was going to go to nursery school where people might know he was adopted, and they didn't know how to prepare him or if they should do so. They have a worker at the agency-at least they had one till she left last month-who was supposed to deal with such problems, but, it came out, they always felt on trial with her and didn't dare confess their worries. They were so relieved when I told them that their concerns were not unusual and were shared by most other adoptive parents. They were so grateful to me, even though I didn't really do all that much for them.",

        "summary": "Why does the patient delay-and almost omit-telling the therapist her good news about being given clinical responsibilities at the agency? Two possibilities suggest themselves: (1) The excitement of her achievement is so stimulating that she cannot handle it comfortably until the end of the session when she can report it without having to discuss it at length. Patients often leave the most important developments to the end of a session for this reason-not deliberately but owing to a temporary, unconscious defensive perceptual gap. (2) The patient may fear that the therapist will not appreciate the significance of her achievement and will, by his lack of response, leave her painfully ashamed of her own excitement. By postponing the telling to the last possible moment, she symbolically minimizes what she is about to say and prepares herself to make a quick exit-maneuvers to ameliorate the hurt she anticipates.\nThe therapist in this case handles both possibilities by his sincere expression of pleasure in her accomplishment and, by implication, in the victory it represents over the anxieties that have frequently prevented her from making the most of her opportunities and abilities. With a patient who had achieved greater insight and objectivity about himself, the therapist, though pleased for him, might well have remained noncommittal, only interpreting the patient's tension and asking him to examine it when the matter came up-as it surely would come up in some form-in the next session. In Miss Banks's situation he chose (I think correctly) to gratify her need reasonably and directly. This difference in approach is often mistakenly couched in terms of whether otte is being \"human\" with a patient: the implication is that the therapist, in gratifying the patient, abandons the therapeutic posture. However, Miss Banks's therapist is not being \"nice\" to her as opposed to being \"therapeutic.\" In taking her need at face value, he makes a calculated move in the treatment.\nBy the same token, there is nothing inhuman or inhumane about abstaining from gratifying a patient's immediate needs if the abstention is in the interest of the therapeutic goal; and if the therapist believes not only that the patient can tolerate the resulting tension, but that the treatment will benefit because optimal anxiety thus generated may enable the patient to mobilize pertinent material. The needs of the treatment-rather than the therapist's consideration of what kind of a person he will seem to be to the patient at the moment-should determine what he says or does not say.\nFrom here on, the sessions with Miss Banks had a spontaneity and rhythm that was not present at the outset of the therapy. There was noticeably less need for the therapist to guide the hour and move it along.\n"

The parents have strong convictions and conveyed them clearly to their children. This kind of background makes for healthy pre-oedipal development-that is, a sense of personal security based on having a clearly defined place in an orderly world. At the same time it may make the child vulnerable to the instinctual impulses that arise unbidden and threaten the child's sense of what is acceptable. Often there is little tolerance for what is deemed evil and unnatural in such families, and the child finds it necessary to reject a part of herself. In Miss Delmore's case I would suspect that the absence of her parents during this crucial period of development made it all the more difficult for her to deal with phantasies that could then develop without being checked by the ameliorating reality that contact with her parents-the persons who were the targets of her sexual drive-would have brought. If as a child she found it necessary to institute a wholesale repression of both her sexual and her aggressive oedipal wishes, then that might explain the difficulties in which she finds herself today, when that repression is threatened by her adult sexual needs and her drive toward motherhood.",

Even if you were an analyst, it would not help; for without the opportunities made possible by frequency of visits, the patient cannot be helped to develop the transference neurosis that is necessary to working through the oedipal wishes that are behind the symptom. All that would happen is that she would become very attached to you without it leading to a therapeutic resolution.

As a rule the patient has agreed with my plan, relieved that the burden of the immediate future was no longer his responsibility. I am, of course, not talking about angry threats that patients make in therapy, or outside it, which are not meant to be carried out but are geared to upsetting the listener. The difference of intent that distinguishes the two kinds of suicidal declaration is usually clear; the angry threat can be interpreted to the patient and the source of his anger can be investigated.\nWhen George asks his question, he is not really interested in the medicolegal nuances of confidentiality and privileged communication. On the surface he is baiting me to see how I will respond-that is, can I handle myself and think on my feet? On a deeper level, as I hear it, he is asking me whether I can really be depended upon to take care of him if things get worse. My answer is truthful, but I am interested not so much in clarifying my position as in addressing the underlying question that I feel he is asking. He seems satisfied with my response, and I let it go at that. If he pursues the matter and points out the seeming contradiction in a promise of confidentiality to which exceptions can be made, I would suggest that he explore the meaning of his need to put me into a bind, and I would cease to attempt to deal with his question as deserving a direct answer.\n"

The old belief may have been that she could work on her homework only if she was interested in it first. Later, she reversed that belief as she saw that as she moved herself to work on her homework, she developed interest. The belief that she had to feel something first before she could do what she wanted was reversed to a new belief—that she could gain a new feeling by taking action first. Another belief the client held may have been that she had to be as smart as her sister in order to do what she wanted. At the same time that this was accepted, we asked how she does the exception, given that it is not as easy for her as it is for her sister. With a raised tone, the question means that we are that much more impressed that she does her work given that it is not as easy as it may be for her sister."

        "summary": "Gradually the descriptions of life after the miracle lead to questions focusing on whether the different behavior that results (in this case, behaving friendly toward her son) could happen or has already happened at some point in the relationship. If so (this is most often the case), the questions then move in the direction of identifying “when and how” this happens.As exemplified by Margaret’s case, when we encounter this sort of answer to the miracle question, we typically start by accepting the client’s description of how the family member becomes different. We then move into asking about how the person who wants the change in his or her family member becomes different as a result of the other person changing. Finally, we ask questions that explore how the interactions change between the people involved.In short, when working with the “Family Members Become Different” answer, there are usually two phases. The first phase involves asking questions that lead to a description of how the miracle changes the other person. The second phase (which is actually a continuation of the dialogue that began in the first phase) focuses on questions that result in a description of how the relationship between the two people will change, and how this in turn will eventually affect the client who originally wanted the other person to change.This example also serves to further emphasize one of the key elements of the miracle question that we consider especially crucial: the necessity of developing a richly detailed description of the miracle that is solidly based on the client’s real, everyday life. Together with the client and the family we try to create an image of the future in which the problems do not exist and the things that the family wants to have happen do so in such a detailed way that it begins to feel almost as if they have already happened. This is particularly important with families and individuals who have been beaten up by life and are in desperate need of an experience in the therapy room that gives them sufficient courage and hope for the hard work involved in making the solution they envision a concrete reality. For this purpose, we try to create an image of the solution, i.e., life after the miracle, that contains as many concrete details as possible, and we try to “travel” in the miracle picture. We create and we live the miracle with descriptions of emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and interactions with other people. The following case will illustrate this idea."

        "reasoning": "The natural question to ask is: “What do you need to do to get one step higher?” Clients often respond with what they need to do, implying action on their part. However, it's crucial for clients to recognize their own signs of progress. This distinction is highlighted in therapy discussions with clients experiencing drug and alcohol issues, where asking about necessary actions may yield useful responses. When clients claim 'I don't know,' therapists can maintain silence to allow clients time for introspection. Clients sometimes describe reaching a '10' on the progress scale, prompting therapists to redirect focus towards identifying smaller, achievable steps. Questions about how others perceive progress can further refine goals to align with clients' everyday realities.",

When you agreed with her opinion instead of reassuring her, she suddenly became more positive and switched to talking about hope. Any ideas why this is so?Of course if the therapist reassures her, she needs to defend herself and her idea. Things have been up and down and so she knows that things being up right now does not mean things will stay that way. Her experience runs counter to that, so caution is very reasonable. Once this is accepted she is free to express her hopes for the future."

How can Mother talk about something she cannot see? There really are so few outward and visible signs of stomachache. So, she can only have some more indirect ways to clue her in. So, she might be able to only say: “He’s in pain” or “He is not in pain,” based on outward and visible signs, i.e., groans, etc. When he says, “I have a stomachache” he is sort of saying “ouch,” which is just a remark—not a sign—which Mother has to accept at face value."

But Robert’s description of things being better is linked to a state that he literally feels inside his stomach. Oftentimes the problem with exceptions like this that are essentially feeling states, is that they are internal, not external. As Robert says here, his friends would not notice. Fortunately, Mom would notice. How do you decide what to do next in situations such as this where the client answers “I don’t know” and both client and observer have described the solution as “feeling better”? Usually feeling state questions do not lead to anything that is externally reinforceable, so I hesitated to focus on feeling better. In the early part of the session it came up as feeling “less” pain and then it came up as “not feeling pain,” and the session began to shift. “It doesn’t ache” is a very different statement than “It would ache less.” After questions following up on what would be happening when it doesn’t ache, the client became more animated and intrigued. The description of the absence of pain made room for the therapist to ask what would be happening instead—the presence of something else instead of the pain— and thereby a description of the solution. Then it follows that the Mother and brothers would notice this, and so you do have some external indicators, reinforcers."
